Always wore a condom, and naturally figured eachother and ourselves out and grew closer. But we had a scare. She felt nauseous and threw up. Scared the hell out of me so we got a pregnancy test. This isn't the first time we've tested before. She's on birth control but I was still scared shitless. The test came out negative fortunately but every time we have sex I get wordied about the condom and pregnancy and I completely lose my sex drive and ability to keep going. \n\nWhat do I do?",

So, I will try my hardest to make this subreddit a good branch off of \/r\/teenagers, where you can give and receive advice. To start this off, I want everyone who reads this to (please) comment with a picture of yourself and a little bit about yourself. What you like to do in your spare time, what music you're into, different hobbies or habits or traits you have that make you different, etc. Anything that comes to mind. Also, try to think of one thing in your life you'd like to improve.

This may sound discouraging, but itÃ¢??s actually liberating. Since you canÃ¢??t control everything, working on the right things is all you have to do.\n3. YouÃ¢??re living in the real world, not a fantasy land. The real world is far from ideal. Be bold, be practical.\n4. You could be heavily disadvantaged. You could be born in a poor family or born with disability. Maybe your hard-earned money was cheated. But donÃ¢??t ever give up. Be resilient and keep moving.\n5. Blaming kills you. When you blame your government, parents and friends for your current situation, you donÃ¢??t solve anything. Instead, you become bitter and get killed from the inside.\n6. You are responsible for all your emotions. Good or bad, emotions are generated by you, not radiated to you by the external circumstances. Master your emotions.\n7. Most people donÃ¢??t care about you. TheyÃ¢??re more concerned about their lives than yours, and thatÃ¢??s perfectly normal.\n8. Love could harm you. Many people are actually harmed, rather than nourished by love. Many harmful actions are done under the name of love.\n9. Your parents are getting older. They canÃ¢??t protect you anymore. itÃ¢??s your turn to protect them now. Grow up.\n10. You may lose health. ItÃ¢??s tempting to sacrifice health for wealth. ThatÃ¢??s putting the cart before the horse. DonÃ¢??t make the mistake - health always comes first.\n11. You are going to die. This is a fact, not a curse.

But recently I dont even know anymore\n\nSo i recently moved back in with my parents after 6 years in boarding school. I thought after not seeing them since the age of 12 I thought it would be a nice chance to reconnect. Boy was I wrong. \n\nI just feel like i guest and Its like my parents cant seem to acknowledge anything i do and am i wrong for wanting acknowledgement? For instance i finished AP chemistry with a 99.8% and all i got was okay so what and a god shut up im busy. I got elected student council president and all they said was resign because theyll just use you as an errand girl. But someone my sister getting a 75 is worth going to dinner and cake?!!?!?!?! I just want something and like sometimes ill complain about the work i have to do and they just say stop complaining you chose to do this or why are you complaining we never forced you to do any of this. Which was right but i just wanted a hey its going to be okay\n\nIm just tired of everything. Im tired that my mother cant seem to bring herself to care to remember anything about me. For instance we had this fight about curtains. My mother had asked me and my sisters what colour curtains we would like for our room. i had said white, and no orange ma cause I hate the colour orange. Next thing I know, im getting orange curtains whilst my sisters get the colours they wanted and when confronted she turned it on to me saying she didnÃ¢??t intentionally do it she just didnÃ¢??t remember mine and that I was being spoiled and should just be grateful that i got curtains in the first place. Another instance was when I had been telling my family i no longer eat pork for health reasons. I said this repeatedly, made a point to avoid pork, and just made the extra mile to ensure I never ingested pork. I come home and dinner is pork belly. I told my mom I couldnt eat this and I was just going to order take out and she flipped out calling me a brat and ungrateful and saying she kept saying how was she supposed to know what I liked and I just wanted to scream and yell at her telling her that she seemed to remember my sisters preferences just fine\n\nThe list goes on with stuff like this and im just tired. I wanna leave my house. I wanna leave and just cut ties with them because i always felt like they just supplemented their lack of love for me with material things and ive tried talking to them and theyre just in constant denial about all of this",

To get a job that pays well enough IÃ¢??ll have to do something with economics and thatÃ¢??s depressing cause I really want to do something in the medical field like my mom but IÃ¢??m too fucking stupid for that.\n\nAlso all my relationships are fucking failing. IÃ¢??m toxic. IÃ¢??m manipulative. I donÃ¢??t mean to be but whenever my dad screams at me I feel bad and start crying so he feels bad to which I feel good. ItÃ¢??s very shitty. \n\nIntimacy scares me and the idea of kissing someone scares me. Or doing something else with a boy in a romantic setting. \n\nI really hate myself. I hate the way I look, I hate the way I am. Just how I talk disgusts me. I have an eating disorder and am even failing with that. End up binging and ruining that shit too.\n\nMentally I feel like IÃ¢??m still a child. Like I never grew past 12. IÃ¢??m 16 now. Idk how 16 year olds act.

I donÃ¢??t eat meat or greasy foods. The few things I do eat I also donÃ¢??t eat bcs idk what the calories are. So I throw that away and then she ends up finding her meals in the trash.

Months pass and I feel like this girl is feeling me too even tho we didnÃ¢??t talk much. I found out she started fooling around w\/ my friend n that discouraged me from askin her out. Then out of nowhere she overdosed n got hospitalized (paralyzed). I hadnÃ¢??t been in contact with her during her hospitalization About half a year later when she got discharged n came back to school she had a walking stick n couldnÃ¢??t walk properly. Her social status decreased n nothing abt her was rly the same. We still talked occasionally but much less. our more meaningful interactions took place on snap,  I still had feelings for her and our convos were awkward but flirty.  I talked to sum friends about my crush on her and they would make fun of her bad walking, which discouraged me even further from asking her out. After a few days straight of texting her, I got a snap from her asking if I wanted to date her. Weirdly It struck me as desperate, like her decrease in social status had made her pick me instead of someone else. at that time I also had a date with a different girl planned. That plus the fear of being criticized about dating  a Ã¢??crippleÃ¢?Â messed with me n i said no. The next day, when I thought of explaining the situation to her as honest as I could, I had found out she was going to be leaving school to focus on physical therapy for her leg. She was out of my life. Nothing came out of that date I mentioned  and skip to now where she hits me up again, just as friends, we talk about our most current romantic relationships which neither are  going well.  We play the 21 question game and I ask her what the deal was w\/ her asking me out. She told me that she had liked me for the longest time, even when I was in relationships with other girls. Immediately I asked her if we could continue the conversation in person, (That may have been too sudden n uncalled for). IÃ¢??m going to see her 2 days from now. IÃ¢??m a person who prioritized face to face communication. Currently IÃ¢??m in a friends w\/ benefits relationship w\/ a different girl but IÃ¢??m planning on meeting up w\/ my crush n explaining to her why I declined the first time she asked me out.

Now I feel that my friends no longer need me and that I am not as smart as I used to be.\n\nMy Oma died along time ago and with my Opa dying and my old dog dying (gift from my Oma) I feel like I've lost all connection to my extended family, not that there was much to begin with. I am beginning to fake smiles a lot more at school and feel that I have to put on an act for my friends.\n\nto add to this I have been seeing my abusive father around town (he still lives close to my family) and feel that there are certain places I used to love that I can't visit anymore due to fear that he would try to talk to me.\n\nDue to all these things and my own depleting self-esteem I have begun to force myself to throw up. I don't to it to much to be worrying but when someone makes a offhand comment about what I eat (it's not their fault. I'm overreacting) I run to the bathroom and try to make myself throw-up. It doesn't always work and that makes me feel worse.\n\ncan someone please tell me how to feel better",

She is talking to a bunch of older guys online.\n\n2 weeks ago she was calling a children's help line asking them what to do because this guy pretended to like her. he convinced her to send nudes then blackmailed her into sending more by sending them to others if she didn't listen. He even found her address.\n\nI thought she had learned her lesson but on Friday she tells me about her boyfriend she met on facebook 3 weeks ago . She tells me he is 17. She's on FaceTime with him when he texts her asking us to make out on camera for him. I called him a perv and then went on with my makeup. I over heard her saying she will send a picture when she disappeared into my bathroom. I told her she shouldn't be sending nudes after what just happened. She says they where not fully naked so its okay. \n\nYesterday I decide to stalk his facebook and it turns out he is 22. I tell her to call me asap. She ended up telling me she knew his age and that he was the love of her life. I tell her how sick he is for being Involved with a child. He can get in so much trouble for even having her pictures. I convince her to end it. \n\nShe explains to me she loves the attention from these guys but it's unhealthy and dangerous.\n\nNow today we FaceTime and she was talking about this 18 hear old that is going to wait 3 years till she turns 18 and they are gonna live together and he loves in the states (we are in Canada). Her mom is my art teacher and I'm debating ruining our friendship by telling her mom because I am worried about her.\n\nIdk if anyone is familar with grooming but this guy she talks to gives her free smokes in exchange for someone to talk to but what happens when she gets desperate for smokes and he asks for more than just a conversation. \n\nShe is constantly putting herself in danger and I can't stand to sit and watch anymore these are sick fucks taking advantage of my young, naive, insecure, and vulnerable friend.\n\nIf you have made it this far and have any opinions please leave them here.",

My 18 yr old brother had to pick me up because I couldn't sleepover at my friend's house like that. It was pretty embarrassing.

I NEVER get in trouble though and my home situation is awkward, my mom hasn't talked to me directly for three days straight. I haven't had my phone for four days.  I snuck my phone last night and saw a text from one of my friends who took me to the party (we don't see each other in school bc track ended) She thought I had been ignoring because I was mad, I tried to explain myself, but I'm worried that without my phone I can't do \"damage control\" I go to a small school and I don't want the wrong people talking about me. I'm the good kid in the family, my other siblings have done some pretty serious bad things and I'm just nervous without my phone\n\nDoes anyone have any advice to help me get my phone back without stealing it?

Unfortunately I'm a very insecure person and I became scared that she was using me as a way to stop herself from being bored. I was scared that she was only talking to me to not be bored but I was too scared to confront her. Instead of confronting her I stopped talking to her completely and I waited for her to confront me. I thought that that would be my only way of talking it out because I was too scared to confront her. Eventually we did talk things out but things were never the same. The worst part is that she had developed feelings for me and was gonna ask me out before I ghosted her. I felt like shit because I hurt the most important person in my life and I missed my one shot at true love. One day I asked if we were still friends and she told me we were but she just hasnt been on social media as much. I responded to that by telling her I felt shitty that things would never be the same and she didnt respond. After that we never spoke again and she ended her social media break so she was back online posting. After months of hoping she would talk to me I blocked her and prepared to end it completely. Eventually I unblocked her but didnt follow her again but the feelings still havent left me. We havent talked in almost a year but my feelings for her are still haunting me. I want to follow her again and try to patch things up but I'm afraid that she thinks I'm a piece of shit and it's not gonna work out. I know this whole situation is happening because I'm an idiot and I did something stupid but I still love her. I dont know what to do or how to fix things and seeking advice here is my last resort.",

For context of the story IÃ¢??m a nineteen year old female, my mom is fifty-two. \n\nI had just went through the process over the weekend of lightening my hair from a burgundy red to silvery blonde (a tough ass process). I was feeling pretty proud of myself and I really loved how I looked. I was sitting in the living room this morning, when out of the blue my mom asks if IÃ¢??m going to put on makeup for work. Now, I work at a daycare, more specifically, IÃ¢??m with the toddlers all day, they could care less what you look like. I essentially tell her this and she proceeds to tell me that it would look better if I did because my acne was flaring up again (it does once a month, gee I wonder why). Honestly,  I had one or two pimples on my cheeks and I wasnÃ¢??t worried because I knew they would go away in a few days. \n\nAround this time last year, however was another story, my acne was horrible despite me washing my face constantly, using prescription grade acne meds, everything. Then it just cleared up one day to a normal amount.\n\nAnyways, I told my mom that putting makeup on it would make it worse. This is where she fires off Ã¢??I just want you to feel good about yourselfÃ¢?Â and I say that I do feel good about myself but her pointing out my flaws that I canÃ¢??t help is making my feel bad. I told her her words made me feel bad and she got mad at me. Mad at me! She got up and said something like Ã¢??I was just trying to helpÃ¢?Â as she was walking out of the room. \n\nNot gonna lie, it hurt a lot.\n\nI understand her side that she grew up in a different time where girls my age were expected to be made up at all time. If she can get with modern technology and other modern views, I wish she could just respect my wishes sometimes. \n\nSheÃ¢??s said other things like this before. When my acne was really bad about a year ago, she told me I needed to put on makeup because it looked like I had cigarette burns on my face (it didnÃ¢??t remotely look like that). \n\nIt wasnÃ¢??t until recently that she quit criticizing my body. The only positive thing she would ever say about my body was I had large boobs but then follow it up with something like Ã¢??it you dropped a few pant sizes you could work at HootersÃ¢?Â. I feel like the only reason she stopped was because she said she felt fat in something she was wearing and before I could stop myself I said Ã¢??how do you think you make me feel everyday.Ã¢?Â Even in sixth grade, at my birthday party, she told me I needed to loose weight because all of my friends were smaller than me.\n\nI just honestly donÃ¢??t know what to at this point. I am happy with how I look and I know thatÃ¢??s all that matters but it is truly taking a toll on my mental health that my mom doesnÃ¢??t like my appearance. \n\nI have tried to address situations where she has hurt my feelings before but she always plays the victim card or she does the thing where she tries to decide she didnÃ¢??t hurt my feelings and itÃ¢??s my fault for feeling that way. \n\nI just need help.",

  "Post": "So I'm a f14 living with my dad and brother.\n\nAbout a year ago my mother split leaving me and my brother with my dad and she moved in with her friend. So at first it was sort of ok just really a shock and I think I may have been in a bit of denial. before my mother left she worked in some mines and was never really here (gone two weeks back 1) two of her days were spent driving and 2 were spent sleeping because its a physically tolling job. When she was home and awake she would spend all day sitting in her chair eating and spending al her time on her phone. She would often criticize how messy our house was and would argue with me constantly. I was dealing with a lot of secret mental health issues and didn't really socialise very well but she certainly didn't even try. This was how it was for a good few years. Then my mother had a cancer scare and sort of went through a midlife crisis. I knew things weren't going well in my parents marriage for quite a while and my mum has some really bad depression. My mum had a really bad time at work because people are bitches so he decided to do something nice for her ( flowers on the bed sort of stuff... it was also her birthday.) So she comes home and tells us shed thought about committing suicide and she needs extra help to get better. I was really worried and sort of took it easy on my hormonal teenage bullshit then the next day I got home from school to find my dad already home and distressed so I ran home and found nothing but a note saying 'sorry I ant anymore' on the table from my mum. I honestly thought shed committed suicide but I found shed taken clothes and calmed down. now things got worse between us, for the first few months she didn't even bother to call or anything and neither did any of her family (my dads side did). when she finally did it was because shed gotten a new boyfriend she wanted us to meet (they started dating 3 weeks after it all happened) I said no, hell no. Then another month past and she hadn't called bcuz my dad and her were sorting out bills and shit. IT was sort of ok for a while, shed take us out shopping or to swim and it was all fun but then she started criticizing my clothing and friends. she actually told me I scrape at the bottom of the barrel for friends bcuz im a loser (in nicer words) and I snapped and told her my friends were scraping for me and that I am a loser with a fucked up family. Then shed managed to clear out all her shit from our house and taken a lot of ours. now this whole time my dads been trying to push me to have a relationship with her and trying to 'stay neutral' while also bad mouthing her. Things got worse and worse until the point I was really depressed and suicidal thinking about or trying to commit suicide. She'd take things that belonged to me for her boyfriends kid without really asking me but I was too anxious to really put up a fight. I eventually found out she was telling people our house was disguisting and that my dad was mentally abusive to her. My dad started drinking again (he was a bit of an alcoholc when I was younger and e isn't particularly nice0 eventhough he had screwed his liver or kidney bcuz of It. He got really mean bcuz of it and started screaming at me and my brother all the time, even throwing a chair at the door and shattering it bcuz I started arguing with my brother. He threatened to hit my brother and me all the time saying we shouldn't start shit until were big enough to fight him, he never actually hit us. Hed thrown me out of the hous for a couple minutes but after each fight hed come back and say he hates fighting with us and that hes sorry but it all felt kind of manipulative. at this point id basically stopped talking to my mum all out but she offered to get an apartment so I could go live with her wich I said no but we started talking again and then we stopped again an dtsarted again and stopped again. anytime I said no to an activity or we got in an argument she wuldnt talk to me for a fww weeks as a sort of punishment. Then Christmas came around and she hadn't talked to me in months and we got into it again bcuz she didnnt talk to me for so long and I asked her how my dad wa so abusive and why she would leave us with him if he was really so bad and she refused to tell me bcuz I was too young but im almost 15. I told her not to talk to me and she hasn't tried to talk with me but now im kind of regretting it. I feel like my dad might be the one manipulating me bcuz ive said things about her that ive heard my dad say and I am rally confused. I want to talk to her but I don't want my dad to find out. What should I do and am I being manipulated? I need to know if telling her to not speak with me was a good idea and should I speak with her again? I'm thinking about taking her up on the apartment offer.\n\nsorry for the long read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my parents got a divorce and I told my mum not to speak with me because she was manipulating me but I'm starting to think my dad is the real manipulator.",

We've had some problems in the past but nothing much. \n\nI never thought something like this could happen, but I'm on my last year of school and there is one Girl on my class...and slowly I started to get closer and closer with her, to a point when she admited that she kinda likes me.\n\nAt first I didn't care, but slowly I started to develop feelings towards her...\n\nAnd for the last 2 weeks, we've been really closed. We started the year always having lunch together, but things started to change since this new year (2020) begun...\n\nWe started to get closer, to actually hold hands from time to time, we eventually even started to hug recently...\n\nI know this is wrong...I've got a GF and I'm developing feelings for another girl...but I just can't stop it.

(we never kissed, just hugs and touches \\[hands\\])\n\nShe always reminds me that I've got a GF and if I want to stay with her (the girl) I would've to make a decision (break up with my GF), but the thing is...it's hard. And I don't even know if thats really what I want. I spend many weekends with my GF, at her house, with her famaly. I don't know if I would have the guts to just end it all, there is just so much history between me and my GF that the thought of just ending it all at once hurts me so much that I have no idea of what to do...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I fked up hard, we (me and the Girl) were going to the center of the village by bus (to take each a train to get back home from school), and at the bus stop (where we had to quit), my GF was there (she was going to take the next bus) and well, I just got out of the bus, kissed her and said I had to hurry to my bus, meanwhile the other Girl she was already moving towards her train (I was not surprised by her reaction), once I finally cought with her, she basically told me to not follow her and she hurried to her train (her eyes were also red), I know what I was doing, I fked up hard...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent her a text apologizing, I know it doesnt change a thing but yeah...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe replied as I'm writting this (40 min after I apologized by text) saying \"Don't talk to me right now\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never thought I would ever write something about my life on reddit, but here I am asking you for help...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I break up with my GF, and start something with the other Girl?\n\nShould I just forget this Girl?\n\nI legit do not know what to do.

I would always but my nails, scratch myself and pick on my cuticles stuff like that. Just last year I had started self harming to cope with my stress at school. I recently stopped biting my nails and harming it was hard but I manage. I have found a way to cope with myself when IÃ¢??m anxious. IÃ¢??ve started pulling out my hair. I pulled out my hair on the middle of my head. And now I have a baled spot. IÃ¢??m really embarrassed of it and donÃ¢??t know what to do. I sound stupid. But for now I have to take my hair up which I also hate doing bc IÃ¢??m insecure. Can anyone tell me how to grow hair back into the bald spot? Or even how long it will take? I will really appreciate it. \nHiii itÃ¢??s been more than a month since I made this post and I have been wearing the same hairstyle so no one can notice.

  "Post": "I need some real help that might even need to be legal help. IÃ¢??m 16 years old, and ever since a young age my parents have had a competitive relationship when it came to me. First off the only real reason they got married was because my mom found out she was pregnant with me when her belly started to show even though she was very skinny. I was mostly raised by my grandmother, who taught me manners, helped me with homework, and told me how beautiful I really was. My mom, however, wanted me to be perfect and slim and perfect. I was always chunky, so every time weÃ¢??d go for our yearly doctor checkup sheÃ¢??d say that IÃ¢??ve been eating a lot and put me on a diet. Every year. For a very very long time. She also wanted me to be athletic, and got mad when IÃ¢??d often get bored with sports, didnÃ¢??t make friends quickly, or wasnÃ¢??t trying my best. I had asthma as a child so running and jumping wasnÃ¢??t really ideal, but my mom would just tell me to puff on my inhaler and go back outside. I get fatigued easily, and so under the hot sun for hours without breaks I would start to see spots and black out, and mom would think I was faking so I could go home. She was mad I wasnÃ¢??t her perfect pageant queen. A 97.6% grade wasnÃ¢??t good enough, it should all be 100% AÃ¢??s and she would pick apart everything. She would make my best seem like not good enough, and make me feel really self conscious. My dad was barely ever there so he was almost like a stranger in my house and me and him were never tight. HeÃ¢??d be on the PlayStation, hanging with friends, or at work. A lot of my problems would get ridden off by them until they wanted to invade my privacy, flaming that the reason I was upset sometimes was because I was doing something bad instead of what I told them. They got a divorce a few months ago and a restraining order but have still not stopped fighting, and often make me choose who I want to be with, and put me in the middle of their arguments and try to make me justify their own beliefs. It has now seeped into my social life where if IÃ¢??m not home on the exact time they said they told me to come by (even though they never said anything at all until they were unsatisfied with how long I was gone) and they blame the other for the rule and how theyÃ¢??re Ã¢??the cool parentÃ¢?Â and I have to cancel some theatre rehearsals to fit their schedules because their matters mean more than mine. \nThis has been going on long enough and they have taken everything I have needed for a long time now and have pushed it to the side, saying the other needs to do it, the other needs to pay for it, the other needs to take you. I canÃ¢??t even get my permit without them fighting, or go to the doctor without making my grandma put her foot down and say enough. I donÃ¢??t know if I could live through another 2 years of this and was wondering if there was a safe way to legally move into my MimiÃ¢??s (grandmas) without my parents freaking out. Where I could get my stuff out of my room and move it into my room at my grandparents without mom saying no and trying to block me from getting my property, and where I can finally live in peace.

Last year, this person started treating me very badly. Losing this person was like losing what I wanted and strived to be. Now it feels like I gave everything away. There's nothing left inside except sorrow and desperation. My body has become useless and my soul is scarred.

Giving and caring is what I want to be. Yet, I just work for him. I just wait for him. Putting my emotions and mental health in constant danger, like an indirect suicide attempt towards my mind.

  "Post": "Some context: I recently moved halfway across the world to attend portage university in the US. My best friend from high school moved to another private university just an hour so we meet all the time. \n\nI should also mention that we took a pretty hard course in high school (IB) and she did not pass on her first try, she has to rewrite a few of her exams and joined in the spring semester. \n\nI've always been more focused on school, maybe a bit too much, and she's kind of the opposite. She's also extremely social, and I find it harder to come out of my she'll. But in every other way we get along perfectly and I couldn't imagine not being friends with her. \n\nSince she's attending college with no aid, and she's not extremely rich or anything, her parents have had to pull quite a few strings to be able to send her to school here. I'm extremely close to her family and I know how proud they are to be sending her here. \n\nAnyway, now she recently told me that she's taking only 3 out of 4 classes this semester even though her parents are paying the full price and she's not going to tell them. That's 11,000 dollars being wasted. I'm so disappointed in her because I know how much effort her parents are putting in to pay for her schooling. She's being extremely ungrateful, and behaving like a spoilt brat in my opinion, especially considering how she barely even passed high school. My parents only sent me to university in the US on the condition that I got a scholarship, and I would be BEYOND grateful if I was in her position.\n\nI just want her to value what she's being given, and take her education seriously. I really want her to do well in life, and right now I don't see her heading in that direction at all. I don't know how to tell her all of this, even reading it back now I sound so preachy. The one time I tried to have this conversation with her she told me I was putting her in a bad mood so I stopped. \n\nI feel terrible for thinking so poorly of someone I value so much in life. She's also doing much better socially while I've completely isolated myself this semester, which I don't totally mind, I like being on my own. But I wonder if I'm subconsciously jealous and looking for reasons to put her down. \n\nPlease tell me if my feelings are valid, and if yes, how should I approach the situation?",

  "Post": "So as the title says I am a senior in high school. Throughout my high school experience I have been a relatively quiet and reserved person who kinda hung out on the edge of the \"main bubble\" of people at my school. For the entirety of my 4 years I have kept pretty much the exact same friends that I have been hanging out with since middle school and I absolutely love them and would do anything for them. However recently, a couple of my friends from my group have really found themselves a lot deeper in the main  bubble and have begun talking to other people and even have gotten girlfriends as a result. Personally I could not feel happier for them and find enjoyment just talking with them about there experiences and such. I feel like it's important to note I am not scared of them moving away from me as a friend so that is not my problem. Due to seeing two of my best friends have this entire other life it seems like it has begun to make me feel quite lonely and left out. I want to try and get into the bubble somehow or just a bubble, but I feel as a senior it is kinda hard to move my way in as the friendships seem to have been found and developed already. I have talked to my two friends about this and it feels like there is not much I can do. The reason they got into the bubble comes from them being invited to a couple of get togethers    \na person or two that were in the bubble already. I feel like for some reason I have not been able to get that kind of opportunity, most likely due to something I have done or haven't done. My friends have told me that they feel I have begun to change personality wise and have started to become more social as a result which is good. I just want to be able to make my last semester of highschool great and maybe have the opportunity to take someone to prom. I also want to break my cycle of waking up, going to school, going to extracurricular, going home, playing video games\/homework and sleeping. I was thinking about asking my two friends that are in the bubble to maybe try and invite me to a couple get together opportunities and see if I could Integrate myself in and become a part of the group but I feel like that is too much to ask and if they wanted me there they would have already invited me. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I  should do and how they would try and deal with my situation if they were me. Sorry if this post seemed all over the place I have wanted to get a lot of stuff off my chest and needed to say a lot. All comments are appreciated.",

  "Post": "Hello! IÃ¢??m a 14F. (and new to reddit!) I have a big issue in school that has been going on for about 2 years now with my friend. My friend (aka Ã¢??CÃ¢??) is a very shy and reserved person whilst IÃ¢??m outgoing and confident, so we are very different. Since the summer of 2017, she has been getting clingier and clinger to me as I begin to talk to more and more people. I donÃ¢??t usually have a problem with this, but it first turned into silence when I tried to involve her in a conversation (which I can understand if sheÃ¢??s nervous) to whenever I talk to someone that isnÃ¢??t her, let alone look at them for more than 5 minutes, she gets angry and storms off looking like a tomato. \n\nThere was an issue back in the summer (2017) when we met a girl who moved into our tutor, but it was the usual school drama - trying to act cool, etc. She was very involved in out friendship circle, but ever since she left, C has been a broken mess that only keeps going downhill as time flows by. At first, I tried being understanding, considering this is C that I am talking about, she mightÃ¢??ve told something private to the new girl. I patiently dealt with her mini temper tantrums for a good while, when eventually all of her wailing and crying turned into loads of messages every. day. IÃ¢??m not actually very good with texting, so IÃ¢??d try my hardest to type back, but, as bad as this makes me sound, it wasnÃ¢??t fun or anything. It was just questions after questions, literally as if she typed up Ã¢??how to have a conversation over text!Ã¢?Â There was even a time when I actually picked up one of her hundreds of calls after school and when i tried actually talking to her, I would just get cut off by more weird questions like:\nÃ¢??What colour is your room?Ã¢?Â\nÃ¢??How many sketchbooks do you have?Ã¢?Â (I like drawing, so this isnÃ¢??t too odd I suppose)\nÃ¢??Can you send me a picture of that?Ã¢?Â\n\nI know it sounds odd. It makes me feel really bad when I look back at it. But eventually I just stopped picking up or responding - they were boring and repetitive. Eventually, I met some more people. (who I now am very close with) When we talk, she just stands somewhere behind me and stays quiet, and when we try to include her, she just says Ã¢??IÃ¢??m fine.Ã¢?Â\n\nRecently, IÃ¢??ve also had another one of my friends (M) try to turn on me by spreading rumours. (IÃ¢??m likely to post about that later!) I can say IÃ¢??ve dealt with that confidently, but C and M keep trying to make fun of me behind my back. M keeps trying to say snarky things whenever I say something and C just backbites and spams me with texts. Whenever C texts me now, I just immediately go angry. IÃ¢??m being patient with them and continuing like normal, but I donÃ¢??t know how I could make this stop or even just deal with this. I would really appreciate advice!",

She said she only sometimes feels like a guy but she doesnt know if that's her just being masculinely gay cause shes also poly so the gay jokes are strong with her all the time. I already told her that I would love her no matter what and no matter who she was but I dont want to be with a guy or even someone that's sometimes a guy. I've been laying in bed just staring as the ceiling thinking about every bit of the future we talked about dissapearing while shes asleep on the phone. I want to tell her that I dont want to be with a guy because of my parents being religious, my friends calling me gay and shit, and just being looked at differently when I'm around her but I dont want to make her feel like a mistake. Otherwise I really wouldn't mind if it meant I got to still have her in some way. Even if its not who I've known for a good portion if my life. If I'm missing something about gender fluidity please explain more and if i could get some help on how to break what i just said to her or even how to cope with possibly losing what we have that would be great\n\nThanks. \n\nAlso this is a throw away so friends that know my actual account dont see this.",

I seriously hate that she said that. When someone treats me wrong I tend to tell myself that in my future I will have nothing to do with them and they wonÃ¢??t be able to come to me for anything. She does this a lot and I try to forget it every time it happens because she has done a lot for me and has some bipolar, but this here I just canÃ¢??t forget or at least right now. idk what to do.",

Since sixth grade, I kinda like this one kid and he kinda liked me but I was always quiet so nothing ever rlly happened. We went to the same high school and we both found a friend group and basically grew up, but when we had classes tg we would always sit and laugh and joke and j generally have a good time. Last year he would always snap me, dm me, try to start convos, uk. Then we talked a little over the summer but again, IÃ¢??m pretty quiet, so not all the time. I always knew I liked him deep down but was always afraid to say it and I was pretty sure he liked me too, bc thatÃ¢??s what all my friends said. When this year started, we still talked for a little, but as the months went on, he found a new friend group full of toxic people and girls who are all over him. We barely talk anymore and even tho I sometimes see him trying to talk to me in the hallway, heÃ¢??s just a completely different person-the attention has gotten to his head and he usually acts like a total asshole now. At the beginning of the year, I was considering telling him I liked him bc, hey weÃ¢??re about to graduate after going to school tg since nursery so what do I have to lose? But now I wanna stop having feelings for him bc heÃ¢??s just not the same. How do I forget someone IÃ¢??ve been interested in for six years??",

I donÃ¢??t know how to explain to this girl that I still want to be with her.\n\nSo, IÃ¢??m 15, I was talking to this girl, who I go to school with, same grade, WeÃ¢??re in highschool, we ArenÃ¢??t dating, weÃ¢??ve both made that clear but we still spend time together and kiss, but donÃ¢??t hug or hold hands weirdly enough, I try but, she doesnÃ¢??t seem to want really to show that kind of affection.

I'm currently looking for advice after four years of dealing with a manipulative and possessive \"friend\". I'm really sorry that this post is quite long...\n\nWe are currently in our last year of school and I look forward to cutting him from my life after I leave. I know I can block him but I'm still worried that he could find ways to contact me, and I know if he does harass me then I can contact the police but I've never done so before and unsure how it would be handled? It makes me anxious not knowing what could happen. My plan was the month we leave to just block him and change my usernames on the accounts I use \/ open new ones so that he wouldn't  know it's me? I'm very unsure of how to handle this abe probably sound very silly but honestly I need some direction, I dont know who I could talk to who would take the situation seriously. \n\nI dont want to have any contact at all with this person as for the last four years he has literally been a plague in my life and has forced me away from my group of friends (one of which I am still very close with but Toxic Friend has threatened us both in the attempt to try and stop us from being close.) And has demanded my immediate attention every single day, even through preliminary exams and actual examinations. My main reason for not blocking him currently is that he will yell abuse at me throughout the day and between classes like he has down previously in the last years that I've tried to block him, and simply being his \"friend\" is the only way to stop him from doing this. \n\nI'm sorry for being such a bother but can anyone advise me on the best way to get him out of my life? Additionally is there any precautions I can take online to keep him away, and offline too? \n\n(In advance sorry if anything is spelled wrong \/ that's weird. Although I've been living in England for six years the English language itself isn't my first. Hopefully you can still read this, sorry!)",

  "Post": "Hey guys! Ever since I could remember my father and I have had a pretty strained relationship. Growing up my father had a very hard time expressing his emotions. For most of my childhood he was always at work and was always thinking about money. I vividly remember being really young, maybe six years old, and him showing me his bills and how much he had to pay. He would explain how much he is doing for me and that I should be thankful for his sacrifices. My whole childhood was spent discussing money, bills and my father's stress about making money and paying the bills. **I felt like his therapist instead of his daughter.** He only seemed to talk to me when he WANTED to rather than being there for me because he was my father. He never really took the time to get to know me, however, he didn't have any problems trying to exercise his control over me. He knew how to push my buttons with guilt, always trying to make me feel like his behavior was MY fault. He was very verbally abusive and didn't hesitate to curse or put me down. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to earn his love through awards, a nearly perfect GPA and a full four-year merit scholarship to college. Little did I know chasing after those things would never make him change. My dad is 62 years old now, and he still hasn't changed. Sure he doesn't yell as much anymore, but he's still the same guy. The only reason he's changed is for HIS own health because HE doesn't want to take in stress although he didn't mind making me and my mother stressed for the past 18 years. I'm at a stage in my life where I no longer felt empathy towards him. I don't know if I should love him. **How can I love my father if I don't like his personality? I really need help because these experiences still cut deep and hurt.** \n\nJust to sum up some of my traumatic experiences\/memories associated with my father:\n\n1. My dad talking non-stop about his stress and piling his emotional pain onto me . His favorite sentence is \"I'm sick\" (even though he isn't sick) and \"My head hurts\". He doesn't know how to have a conversation that doesn't involve HIM. It is always about him, his life and his problems. \n2. He only talked about money and bills. He always painted money in a negative light, and constantly reminded me of how sad and stressed he was about paying our bills. As a result, he made me feel like a burden on him. \n3. He likes drinking and socializing more than being a father. The only time I've seen my father really happy is when he drinking or with friends. He may stress about money but does not hesitate to buy a big bottle of alcohol for him and his friends. He drinks almost every night and self medicates his pain with alcohol. \n4. He use to be aggressive when I was a child. He would swerve the car if he got mad and his yell was very very very loud. He would basically scream in our faces and threaten to hit us if we challenged him or his authority. \n5. I saw him treat my mother like shit. He never once respected my mother or the work that she does to provide for me and my family. I watched him yell at her and curse at her. The first traumatic memory I have had of my father is him yelling and screaming and cursing at my mother to the point she left our apartment and ran out the door. I was five. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for taking the time to read about my emotions, it means a lot!",

  "Post": "Here is a little background: I am 14 and have straight aÃ¢??s. I have a little brother who is only 5 and has temper problems. He gets mad on the slightest things I do. For example, today, I was eating my breakfast and my little brother was watching a video on a laptop. He then said Ã¢??Wow this is my favorite episodeÃ¢?Â in Armenian. I looked over to see a glimpse of what his favorite episode was and then he started screaming and closed the laptop really hard. He quickly ran to my mom who saw everything and started telling her about how I peered at his laptop. My dad quickly came and picked him up and said Ã¢??WHY DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE YOUR BROTHER CRY?!Ã¢?Â My baby brother was still yelling and crying in frustration and my mom was also very disappointed at me and said to my dad to take me to my Granparents house. I started telling them that I did not do anything bad and that my brother was screaming for no reason. They did not listen to me and my dad said Ã¢??ok, if you are going to be like this for the whole summer, we will take you to summer school!Ã¢?Â And then I said Ã¢??if you do that, I will fail every class.Ã¢?Â Then he got mad and I went to my bedroom in frustration. See, this happens every day and I am done with it. Please give me advice on how to solve this problem and why my parents are always on my brothers side.",

He learned that i was interested in crimes ( as i love to LEARN about the mental state and all since i wish to be a psycological student ) and he told me that he wished to do a school shooting. He already planned it when he was still in high school , he is now 21 ( i am soon to be 18 ) and not long ago he told me : give me less than a year and i will do it ( the shooting ) . He recently got some real guns .. I al afraid and don't know what to do. But more over , he was in love with me. But obssesively in love with me , scarily in love with me . I then tried to avoid him as i am no longer single . I never gave him mixed signals or anything. And lately he \"lost\" all his memories and doesn't remember me. I haven't seen him since , but as we have common friends i still hear about him , and he still wants to do a school shooting. I really don't know what to do , as i really care for him and still think of him as a great friend , but i am quite stressed out and lost.. Please help me ( ps: i live in france )\nUPDATE: I finally gathered the courage to talk about to a school staff. They called a security agent ( who is also a police officer) and they're going to take care of it and keep me updated about it. I soon have to meet this agent to see what she can do , and if she thinks i need protection or something. Thank you guys for  all the usefull advices . I'll keep you updated.\n\nUpdate:\nIt's been almost a year now, and here's what happened.\nI went to the police station and pleaded against him. he was arrested for over a week and his name is in the police's files as potential terrorist . \nI've talked to him once after that but stopped as it made my \"trauma\" worst.\n\nAll I know is that now he hates me , but still talks about me a. lot to an old friend of mine ( both of them meet at a club and talk about me) or at least that's what the old friend told me.\nI've seen him around town , and he sent me death glares, but I guess it is expected.\nI don't know where he is mentally but , I know he saw\/ still see (?) a psychiatrist, which can only be good , right ?\n\nanyways , even after all this time I still think about it and it makes me feel bad . Thank you for your support, It means a lot .",

IÃ¢??d have to beg to hang out with them, as if hanging out with my friends is a holiday thing. I canÃ¢??t leave the house and do things for myself.

I donÃ¢??t drink, smoke, etc. But I canÃ¢??t even walk out the house and go to the park by myself :( \n\nBut now, my depression has gotten so bad that IÃ¢??m starting to get lazy doing my school work, the only thing I had motivation to do.

However, the time this dance is on clashes with martial arts (tkd specifically).\n\nThe thing is... IÃ¢??m not sure if I want to do tkd anymore. I used to love it and have a passion for it but now I dread Tuesdays and fridays (when I have it). One of my instructors works at a gym as a personal trainer, so we spend majority of the session doing really hard and tiring exercises, bare in mind that IÃ¢??m 14, and one of the older ones. But IÃ¢??ve been doing tkd for years, my sister does it and IÃ¢??ve competed and won stuff. I feel like itÃ¢??s a big part of my identity and what makes me me. I just donÃ¢??t enjoy it anymore. My black belt grading is soon, (2 months) so I canÃ¢??t miss any sessions.\n\nAlso I now donÃ¢??t like competitions. Back in February 2019 I broke both bones in my wrist fighting someone at training. Since then, IÃ¢??ve kind of been scared that IÃ¢??m gonna get injured and IÃ¢??ve moved up a category too (lightweight to middleweight). The girls in this category are a lot bigger than me so this makes me even more scared.\n\nSo all of this in account, idk if I wanna do it anymore. If I stopped I would feel like IÃ¢??m betraying my instructor and all my friends there (basically family). But I really want to start dance. My friend would join it too because she is free but I am obviously not. Also, IÃ¢??ve never really done dance before (unless u count baby ballet) and if I joined a different club all by myself IÃ¢??d be really behind and lonely. I JUST DONÃ¢??T KNOW! \n\nI guess I could quit tkd after I make black belt, but that would feel wrong as it would look like IÃ¢??m only in it to get a black belt. \nPlease help! I need advice! IÃ¢??m aware that this is a lot to read and probably doesnÃ¢??t make sense but I will take any advice I can get.\nThanks x",

I am usually tired and uninterested at some lessons. When I need to do homework I can't write 15 minutes without checking my phone or PC. It is not like I don't find meaning in what I do, in fact I do. The problem is I am too tired to try. I had this feeling for like 2 years.

So um something really really bothered me a few days ago and i didnÃ¢??t know what to do so here iÃ¢??am.. \nSo let me start of the beginning, iÃ¢??m a junior in high school and well my main classes are with people that iÃ¢??m not really friends with. but with time i met 3 girls in my class and became friends  , ( letÃ¢??s say Candice , Clara and Jane )the 3 arenÃ¢??t friends.. , anyways. with time we really started  having fun together in every single class even outside of school \/ we go out and do projects together and even created a groupchat for the 4 of us.. and we got pretty close that  we literally tell each other our secrets ( you know the type of stuff you tell someone when youÃ¢??re pretty confortable & close with them). Anyways , something happened a few days ago that made me confused? upset? idk honestly.. something really serious happened to Jane and her ex crush, and she told us the evening that something happened, and when we were waiting for her to tell us she literally turned to me and said : Ã¢??Sorry but iÃ¢??m not telling youÃ¢?? , I was like Ã¢??What whyÃ¢?? but she said that sheÃ¢??s kidding, i brushed it off anyways. That night in the group chat jane said : come on candice iÃ¢??m gonna tellÃ¢??you what happened cuz you need to know but candice said that sheÃ¢??s not home so she canÃ¢??t really talk , then she asked clara if sheÃ¢??s available to talk, clara was outside too, I was LITERALLY waiting for her to tell me but she didnÃ¢??t even mention my name. so i texted the group Ã¢??hey what abt me? am I inexistant or what?Ã¢?? so she said : Ã¢??lol just kiddingÃ¢?? and the convo stopped  there. \nThe next day, Jane didnÃ¢??t come to school, and i literally heard the other two : candice and clara talking about that Ã¢??secretÃ¢?? and she was like Ã¢??what do you think?Ã¢?? when i heard that i immediately knew that jane told them and not me, i didnÃ¢??t even bother to ask them. So i went to janeÃ¢??s best friend (whom iÃ¢??m friends with too) and i asked her if she told you about the matter , her best friend said yes she told me and i was like wow she didnÃ¢??t even tell me and told candice and clara, why do you think she didnÃ¢??t tell me? so her best friend literally said : its something really personal , candice and clara are really close so ofc she told them but you and her are just simple friends so ofc she wonÃ¢??t tell you . Those words shocked the F outta me . How the hell are we Ã‚Â´simpleÃ¢?? friends ??? was she considering me a Ã¢??simpleÃ¢?? friend after all? why does she consider the other 2 closer than me since we literally became friends at the same time. like we didnÃ¢??t know each other before junior year. I felt disappointment and a little bit of sadness.. That night she (jane) texted the groupchat :Ã¢??how did you react when you saw him guysÃ¢?? and she was literally talking to the other 2 girls.  Anyways after that , i found out about something else : that the other one (candice) told something to the other 2 and not me. \nI felt that i was hella excluded from the circle and i shed some tears that night\ni had so many questions like : Why are they hiding stuff from me , why arenÃ¢??t they treating me like theyÃ¢??re treating each other. We literally became ( the 4 of us ) friends at the same period of time so why is it so unfair. \nSo please help me , what should i do guys? iÃ¢??m literally lost .",

Everyone already knows each other and have they're groups. I dont like approaching groups since I dont want to just interrupt them and it would be super awkward having a strange kid just walk up to you and your friends, stare at you, and try to join your conversation. Because of this I dont have any friends and just a few acquaintances and I sit alone for lunch everyday. It didnt bother me at first but it begins to suck more and more as time goes on.\n\nI feel like the hardest part for me is making and holding conversations. It's been such a long time since I've had to talk to someone I didn't know and didn't know me that it's really hard. It's hard for me find topics to talk about . And if we don't have the same interest what then? It just leads to awkward silence. I'm bad at keeping the conversation going so sometimes people will ask me things and I awnser without thinking and dont ask \"You?\" so it just stops there. Its been such a long time since I've har a chance to be myself that I dont remember how to be myself so I'm not as funny or entertaining. How do I fix these problems?",

  "Post": "I don't really know what I'm doing as I write this. Maybe it's just the last thing I haven't tried. Maybe I just need to say it out loud. I don't know, but here goes regardless. What you are reading is the uncensored, unfiltered process of my mind. I have never been this vulnerable to anyone, even myself, but I feel like I need to be vulnerable somehow to someone, and this is the only way I can think to do it.\n\nMy name is Tyler Cooper. I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, but since then I have lived in San Antonio and Maryland, respectively. I am 17 when I write this, going on 18 in three months. I add this incredibly personal information not only to tell you who I am as a human, but also to force myself to say things I instinctively hide.\n\nI fell in love with someone who barely knew my name. She was the prettiest, smartest, kindest, and brightest person I ever met. Her megawatt smile used to be the only thing I looked forward to when I woke up at 4:00 each morning for early morning classes before school. Despite this, we never hung out. I wasn't 16 yet and my parents would have torn my spine out if I dated anyone before then, so I tried my best to keep things casual but it went nowhere fast. I knew where the line was between friend and stalker, and I was dangerously close to it. By the time I finally had my 16th birthday, not even 2 weeks before the day, my family packed up and moved to Maryland so my mom could continue her PhD. I was a wreck. Still am, some nights. I was so desperate I tried to start a relationship long distance to keep in touch, but all that did was burn that bridge entirely. I definitely came off as creepy, and in her shoes, I would do the same thing. I tried so damn hard to move on. I went on half a dozen dates with random girls whom I could tolerate, but just didn't connect with. I can't go back to San Antonio, where she lives. I don't have any chance at a career there without changing some major life decisions, and even if I did, I would be stupid to think she would take a chance on me after how I acted. She's probably already gone steady with someone by now, though it kills me to admit it. \n\nThis isn't fair. I'm ruining myself over someone else. She didn't do anything wrong. She didn't mean to hurt me this badly. This is all my fault, because I'm an idiot and a hopeless romantic who has no clue in his walnut-sized skull how to move on from a lost cause. My grades are plummeting. I'm not eating as much as I'm supposed to. I tried dating other people and making new friends, but after a year of that I just want to be left alone. I tried suicide probably a dozen times, each time getting saved by a miracle. My therapist is trying so hard to help and he is doing a fantastic job, but no matter how hard I try I can't get past this one person. She means everything to me, even now. I used to feel butterflies anytime I thought of her. Now it's more like moths, filling me up so I want to vomit, acting as a cruel reminder of what should have been, but because of me, became something worthless.\n\nShe was lightyears out of my league for sure. She was beautiful. Hot, even, but she was so much more. She was ivy-league smart and friendly enough to make Robin Williams look coarse. She started wearing glasses during 6th grade that made her face shine even brighter, but when she eventually traded them for contacts, somehow that was even more radiant than before. Still, I liked to think I had a chance. I had to think that, in a way. There wasn't much choice, or so I assumed back then. She never once said a single word that lowered my self esteem. Even when she rejected me over text, she was kind and polite and understanding in ways no one else ever was to me. Even my closest family have never come close. Directly, she couldn't harm a fly, but indirectly, by virtue of simply being perfect, she ruined relationships for me. How can I possibly love someone who gets angry too easily or can't hold a conversation when I know that SHE exists? I judge people harsher than they deserve, because I've seen someone that no one could compare to, including myself.\n\nI don't want sympathy. I have a therapist for that. I don't want a pep talk or any meditation or hypnosis tricks. Trust me, if you've heard of it, or even thought of it, I've already tried it 6 times. If you want to give me advice, just make sure you bring the receipt cause I've probably heard it a thousand times before. In all honesty, what I'm asking for is a miracle. Call this a prayer, if you will. A desperate scream into the void of the internet from a shattered boy who wishes he could love. I don't care if a million people see this. I don't care if 2 people see it. All I want is some hope that I will fall in love, and at this point the closest thing I have to love is faith. It may seem stupid at first, but I've seen the internet grant wishes before. I've seen medical bills paid and trees planted and even lives saved by communities of total strangers. I ask for a miracle, yes, but not a big one. I don't need someone to remove a tumor or save a village or send a satellite into space. I just need someone to tell me why everything will be okay. And yes, that would be a miracle.\n\nBecause I already know it won't be.",

  "Post": "Hi there, IÃ¢??m 19 and I still live at home and lately my mother has become so unbearable. Me and my mom have always been really close but living with her is impossible, I donÃ¢??t even know where to start. \nFirst of all my mom is really weird about the house being clean and tidy. She works full time and I can understand that coming home to a clean house is something that is appealing to her. I am the only person in the house who doesnÃ¢??t work also so I understand where her expectations come from. I mostly stay with my boyfriend over night every night at his and then come back to mine in the morning to walk my dog and just have some time to myself. Normally I WILL tidy up all of the dishes that her, my brother and my dad used in the morning and just around the kitchen and the living room. Cool whatever. However today I generally just forgot to clean their dishes and I sh* t you not there was literally one plate a few forks and knives a cup and a grater. I came home at 11 am walked my dog and started painting. I love painting and I was really excited this new painting ive been doing so naturally I spent a good few hours on it. She came home and started shouting at me because I never did the dishes. Honestly if you were a third person watching the way my mum behaves sometimes you would think she was just joking. She just get so engulfed with rage when the house isnÃ¢??t perfect and tidy and clean and its really affecting me now because the only time she ever opens her mouth it is to complain or shout. No one else thinks the house is messy its just her. And whenever I do do something for her there is no acknowledgement there she just expects it from me.Im so sick and tired of it I was having such a good day and then as soon as she walks in the door the nice energy in the room just disappears and its just poisoned with her constant nagging and negativity. After listening to her getting all up in my face telling me how lazy and selfish I am I try to explain to her the way she makes me feel and the way she behaves and she will just shut me down, walk away or slam a door in my face. SheÃ¢??s always the victim in everything and Im always the selfish lazy bitch of a daughter who doesnÃ¢??t think of anyone else ever. The only reason IÃ¢??m spending more time at home is because she told me to. She said I was spending too much time with my boyfriend and that she barely got to see me which honestly is probably for the best. She will go nuts if there are fingerprints on the fridge... I dont know but I feel thats a bit extreme. Im so done with it its just getting old and she only seems to be getting worse as time goes on. Usually I avoid confrontations with her and just do as she expects of me but its days like this where I slip up that literally make me want to run away so far from this house. My boyfriends mom is so chill and her daughter has cystic fibrosis so she is a stay at home mom. She is always so calm and her energy is amazing, im sure the last thing thats on her mind when she goes to sleep at night is if there are any dishes left in the sink and whos getting it in the morning....\nI wish my mum could realize how much life she is WASTING by moaning all the time over such miniscule things, and how much it affects our family. No one wants to be around her when shes like that, but its just the way she is.\nI know its a terrible thing for me to compare my mom to my bfÃ¢??s but sheÃ¢??s just so much nicer to be around in a house environment.  Is there any way for me to just accept the way my mom is and for me to block out whenever sheÃ¢??s being difficult? I love her so much but I canÃ¢??t live with her anymore:(( please help",

We went to different high schools and kept in touch over the phone. I started liking her slowly in freshman year and eventually it kept getting worse as we kept talking and meeting up. (She is also gay btw). At first I thought I could ignore it and it would pass but itÃ¢??s been nearly 3 years and I like her more ughhhh. Im pretty sure she sees my as a little sister type friend. For next year (senior year) we are going to the same school and we have been talking a lot more and seeing each other more often. This is definitely me over analyzing but recently sheÃ¢??s been a bit more touchy and even kinda asked to give me a hickey when we got drunk at a party lol. But she did tell me about a girl she said she might like. So I donÃ¢??t really think she likes me that way. Ok I donÃ¢??t want to sound all Ã¢??dramatic teenage girlÃ¢?Â but I do have a couple mental health issues I guess, and she kind of knows about them? But like not in depth. I always tell her not to worry and nothing is wrong because I feel bad putting a burden like me on her but IÃ¢??m pretty sure she knows IÃ¢??m lying so IÃ¢??m pretty pissed at myself for letting her know that much because now she probably pities me and I really donÃ¢??t want that. ItÃ¢??s a really complicated thing and I just donÃ¢??t want to like her that way. Even in the nonexistent chance she felt the same, IÃ¢??d feel guilty dating her because IÃ¢??d kind of drag her down because sheÃ¢??s just such an amazing person and IÃ¢??m not. (Wow sorry this sounds so dramatic lol). Hell I even feel guilty being friends with her because I donÃ¢??t like making her worry or pity me. But the worst part is that if I had any chance to date her, my selfish, dumb self would go for it in an instant. If I asked her out it would just look so pathetic on my part since she already probably sees me as impulsive, damaged, and childlike. Ugh sorry IÃ¢??m dumping a 3 year long complex onto the person reading this. \n\nOk so now that I unloaded my cringeworthy girl issues and other personal issues on the poor reader, what the hell am I supposed to do?? IÃ¢??m still trying to get over her and she has no idea I like her. Do I tell her?? Should I ask her out? Should I wait it out? Am I overanalyzing?? I just kind of feel like shit and really need some advice on how to deal with this situation.",

  "Post": "I think a lot about my past looking for reasons as to why I'm the anxious, depressed, and emotional person I am. I used to be incredibly aggressive as well as a child but now I don't even like to yell. Any sort of aggression around me throws me into this frightened panic mode and i begin to frantically search for a way out of the situation. I say I think about my past because... as a kid, I was highly aggressive and threw lots of tantrums even at the age of 13. My mom would discipline me severely and that's all I  thought it was. Discipline. I only began to question it after I turned 17 and am still uncertain of it now at the age of 19. As a child I was diagnosed with RAD (Reactive Attachment Disorder) and I'm not sure if I still have it or if it's gone. I'm also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When my mom spoke to my therapists, she wouldn't hesitate to tell them every single thing I did, whether it be acting out or having no remorse, though she never told them what she did in response and I didn't tell my therapist about what happened at home either. I was afraid of more discipline or my mom getting in trouble resulting in even worse discipline. My mom, to this day, guilt trips me for my behavior as a kid. Asking where she went wrong and if she was a bad parent and why did God give her such misbehaving children. Sorry for the rant, I just want for anyone able to answer to get a vague understanding of my past as a kid before I ask. One of these days where I was incredibly angry and wanted to be left alone, my mother persisted on bothering me and further agitating me when i just wanted to be left alone to calm down and I stated so. This was when I was 12. She ignored my plea\/request and continued to yell at me and it got to the point where her boyfriend came upstairs to see what was up. I heatedly kept telling them to please just leave me alone and tried to fight my way past them since they were making no moves to leave. My mom, already in a defensive mood, got more angry and started to wrestle with me and hold me down. I tried to get away but she told her boyfriend to hold me down and he helped her in doing so.  He held my wrists with my arms outstretched above my head and she had her entire body weight on my legs. Mind you, I was merely 12... I'm sure none of this was necessary but at the same time... anyways, my mom kept repeating the question \"Are you going to calm down?\" Over and over as i cried splayed in that position because it's what I was trying to do in the first place. I was held there on the floor by my bed for 3 hours. Before the three hour mark, my mom force fed me Tylenol to \"calm me down\" even though I had already given up on trying to move.  When she asked her question \"Are you going to calm down?\" Again, I answered \"Yes\" weakly and defeatedly so I could get some feeling back into my hands and legs. When they let go and I was finally able to move, I stayed on the floor and curled into a ball and cried because my arms and legs hurt when I moved them after being stuck that  way for so long. They went back downstairs and I passed out either from crying, or all the tylenol she gave me. So my question to the answerer is, Does that count as abuse? My mom has been extremely disciplinary my whole life. I'm not sure anymore though. I only began questioning it 3 years ago. I just don't know for sure and I don't want to talk to my therapist about it incase it's nothing.  I just really want to get to the bottom of my mental and emotional issues so I can have a long lasting and healthy relationship because trusting and speaking out to my significant other is very difficult and he's very patient but the way I am is unhealthy and I know that. I don't want my relationship or future relationships with friends and family  to be ruined because of my fears and inability to address my feelings. ",

First off I went through puberty within the space of a few months when I was 11, It took 3 days for my voice to fully break(freaked the hell out of everyone) and a further 3 months aprox for leg hair ect. However I never developed an attraction to girls nor facial hair(I also stopped growing but that might be normal I'm 5 foot 10). During the summer a few things happened: first I began to grow facial hair, second after my emotions going a tad haywire(bouncing between depression and hyperactivity for almost a month) I started to realize that I'm now finding girls attractive, Despite having stopped growing while I was 12 recently my shoulders are becoming wider and my arms longer, I also have been told that my face has started to become narrower and that I appear to be losing weight(I'm quite healthy in regards to weight but suddenly my apatite is bigger and I'm told I'm losing weight) This seems similar to what I experienced before I had my growth spurt as a kid.\n\nMy main question is does what is happening seem like what I think it is? (Is it possible for puberty to kind of pause for several years?)",

When I say \"be a boy\", I want to keep my woman parts but dress as a boy, and identify as a boy. I need some advice reddit! As you could imagine, I have no one to talk to directly that I wouldn't be extremely embarrassed to admit this little problem I am in.\nThanks in advance, Reddit has always been helpful to me. (:",

My father has up to now been paying for everything for me besides gas (Food, Insurance, Phone etc.). But he gets very  harsh sometimes, and I have been talking about moving out. I work in the technology industry for Cisco making 10$ an hour until i can get some certifications. Right now i have lined up around a 1000$ apartment with three friends of mine all with stable incomes who i have known since grade school. After adding up all other costs to live i picture it to be about 1100$ to 1300$ a month to get by which leaves me with about 400 or 500$ a month extra. Right now i am finishing up my first year in college but I'm not doing the best because i also work at McDonald's -_- in total i push around 60 hours a week and every time they offer help at my school it's always at inconvenient times. Also i spend around 400$ a month right now in gas, which is another reason I'd like to move because the apartment will be within biking distance to both my office and McDonald's. Basically i think I'll be able to survive without going under an living paycheck to paycheck. Does anyone have any experience or advice into this subject? \n\nThank you,\n\nBrian",

I'm just incredibly bored.\n\nMy other friends watch anime all day, watch Netflix, draw, read or whatever and everything just seems incredibly boring to do. I lost my 3 main friends after finishing my GCSE exams as they all parted to either jobs or other colleges, and have been trying to fit in with another group of friends, which is realistically going pretty well, but have only been friends with them for around 6 months. I ask to play video games, go to the movies or go around each other houses but they say that its boring, and frankly, i agree with them. Everything that used to give me joy now seems boring and gives me a feeling of nothingness, a feeling that can only be descirbed as nothing\/boring\/pointless. I really want to do things to make me happy again, but it feels like ive lost all feelings within my body, my friends have a similar feeling, it also doesnt help that most of the exiting stuff is also pretty expensive. The main problem is that most of the other friend groups at school seem to have a similar a problem as i speak of it regularly to them.\n\nIs this a normal feeling or do i have a craving for affection from friends. I ask \"do i have a craving for affection from friends\" as the recent break from school, lasting for 1 week, i was INCREDIBLY bored, and by the 4th day i couldnt bear it, and just wanted to curl into a ball, lay there silently and wait until this feeling went away. I found that my eating habits went to sh!T, eating only 1 meal per day and just silently wallowing in my own sorrow for the remaining 5 days. I found that even a message from friends was enough to satisfy me for another few hours, but then these feeling would begin to come back and i would just crave for another message\/interaction\/notifiation from my friends.\n\nI know these are symptoms of mental health problems, but my main quesiton is, Why do these feeling go away from simple messages\/talking to my friends or even random strangers on the internet? Is it me being clingy to my friends? is this completly normal? do i have a form of a mental problem?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated on this subject .\n\n# Ã°???",

After growing up with their religion I have chosen to not be in it. I am the only child in the whole family still \"in the religion\" and they have called me their only hope which puts pressure on me that I don't want. I have tried before to tell them I don't want to be a part of their religion but when I did they said I was disappointing them after all they have done for me (if i didn't go to when them when I was a year old then i would have gone to my mothers grandparents who i don't know.) and my grandma even cried. Before confessing this I have indiscreetly asked what they would do if I didn't want to be a witness and they said that as long as I am under their house they would take me to church if i wanted to go or not. Growing up in the \"truth\" I know for a fact that Jehovah's Witnesses believe that no one should be forced into their religion.  I was planning on leaving the religion and getting a job at 16 to save up money to be able to live after 18 as they will probably kick me out. But after confessing the first time and seeing their sadness I begun thinking that me wanting to do my own thing is wrong and that I should just suck it up and be unhappy but make them happy which is what I have been doing. Also if I continue to go after becoming inactive people would look at me with disappointment which would hurt me emotionally. I seriously don't know what to think about this so any advice at all is happily welcomed and worshiped.",

  "Post": "I posted here a few days ago and since then things have gotten worse. \n\nMy thoughts have lead me to wanting weed and to run away over the past few days. Nothing unordinary has happened so I donÃ¢??t understand what is wrong with me. \n\nMy mood just switches so quickly, for example: earlier today my mum and I were watching tv and I lashed out because she started talking over the program. I wasnt even that invested in the program so I donÃ¢??t understand why?\n\nThis night too (itÃ¢??s currently 5:15am as im writing this) my mentality hasnt been the greatest. IÃ¢??ve had thoughts about becoming annorexic or bullimic and each thought that has consumed me tonight has lead me to suicide. \n\nYouÃ¢??d think IÃ¢??d be happy that I have group therapy sessions to go to over easter, or that I have a 1-2-1 therapy session coming up (Im on a 6 month waiting list for that). YouÃ¢??d think IÃ¢??d be happy that IÃ¢??ve come in contact with an old friend. YouÃ¢??d think iÃ¢??d be happy that I have everything IÃ¢??ve always wanted such as a puppy, a cat, a computer, a big room. But none of this stuff makes me happy at all and I donÃ¢??t understand why. Why donÃ¢??t I feel happy or privileged that these things are happening in my life? I really donÃ¢??t understand. \n\nThe only reason I think IÃ¢??m unhappy is because of me, IÃ¢??m me. Im fat, vile, disgusting. Im horrible to everyone, rude to everyone I meet. I dont listen to people, I dont listen to instructions. I zone out and get clouded with my thoughts then when I zone back in I feel terrible for missing what people say and I zone out again and tell myself Ã¢??Im so stupidÃ¢?Â or Ã¢??Just f**king listen to themÃ¢?Â. But I cant zone back in and its often too late when I do. Its the same with people giving advice. I canÃ¢??t take it. I try to, I try so hard to but instead go back to old habbits that I cant seem to change. \n\nIÃ¢??ve tried getting help from an online friend but he doesnÃ¢??t seem to understand anymore, not like he used to. He helped me with issues with my ex, he calmed me down when my ex spoke about killing himself, he calmed me down when I thought this other girl was trying to get with my ex and he liked her too. But I lost everything with him because my anxiety spiraled out of control. No one knew how much I cried the five months I was so scared of losing my ex. I cried atleast twice a week. Two of the months I cried so much over him but he never cared. HeÃ¢??d just disappear and make me wonder again. HeÃ¢??d make me think heÃ¢??d killed himself, or that he hated me. \n\nWhen we ended things, he proved how much he hated me. I was high when we officially brokeup but heÃ¢??d hinted that he wanted that for weeks and I didnÃ¢??t notice until I was stoned out of my mind and happy for the first time in so long. And its weird because I stayed happy for a few days after. The day we ended things he said heÃ¢??d Ã¢??found someone elseÃ¢?Â and said Ã¢??she helped him when he was going through thingsÃ¢?Â. And now I look back at that, I wish I was that person, I wish he loved me back and trusted me too. \n\nThe past month IÃ¢??ve been feeling what I didnÃ¢??t when we brokeup. IÃ¢??ve wanted to message him, show him how much I loved him. But was it really love? He didnÃ¢??t love me back? So was it just an attachment? \n\nI get attached easily, I trust easily too. Thats something else thats wrong with me. I should know I canÃ¢??t trust people when theyÃ¢??ve already given me a reason not to, but I just dive into the deepend and trust them all over again, I dont just dip my toe in to see if I can, I keep diving in and drowning all over again. Sometimes its the same people, sometimes its new people. But I let go of the anxiety for a moment then realise IÃ¢??ve done this wrong again and itÃ¢??s going to go terrible. \n\nThats something I think about alot. I think about this when it starts to get dark, I think about how I cant get myself into college, I think about how much I weigh, I think about how ugly I look, I think about the scars on my arms, my stomach and legs. I think about everything. And then I canÃ¢??t sleep at night. I canÃ¢??t sleep until I pass out. \n\nIts a loop that is like a neverending tournado that I cant escape and Im stuck in going around and around. I cant sleep, so I canÃ¢??t get myself to college. I cant get to college, so I cant see friends and people that make me happy. I cant see these people, so I get sad and selfharm. I selfharm and start eating to try and feel bettwr. Then I cant sleep because I ate at the wrong time. \n\nAnd I donÃ¢??t know when its going to end. Maybe itÃ¢??ll end when my sleep schedule becomes normal again? Maybe itÃ¢??ll end when I learn to grow up? Maybe itÃ¢??ll end when Im dead? \n\nTo growup I need to be happy though right? To be dead iÃ¢??d have to not be scared of killing myself? To fix my schedule.. I dont know. Im lost.",

My mom just came downstairs to have a \"chat\" about the relationship between my sisters and I. My sisters both go the university while I'm still stuck in high-school. I usually can not get a conversation going with my mom because she thinks I have a bad attitude and don't try to make friends. I get really pissed off everytime my mom tells to change and make some friends at school. It's not like I don't try to make friends, but the girls in my grade are very materialistic and really enjoy gossiping. I'm not that type of person to go around and start spreading rumours. Therefore, I'm only acquaintances with the girls. I'm more better off talking to boys cause they're chill and fine with the jokes I make. After all, the guys don't take the things I say to heart. On the other hand, my mom doesn't like the idea of me having friends that are boys because they are guys. I have a cousin and that's like the closest friend I've got. However, I don't tell him my secrets because it's highly likely that he'll tell my sisters. My sisters are always busy cause they're in university. Sometimes they're not as busy, so we try to sit down and try to talk. Once I start talking another talks over me and completely ignores me. My mom always tells me to be nice and listen to others, but they don't do the same and take advantage of it. What can I do, can anyone tell me?",

The \"boy\" is already like 20 years old. Youngest sister is 14, oldest is 16. I'm 16 too. Now when my mom and her new partner started to take the relationship seriously, I went to their house, and they came over to ours. I got kinda close to the oldest sister. We told eachother that we wanted to kiss. One night, I don't remember why, the oldest sister was spending the night at my moms. Only my mom, the oldest sister and me were home. We were watching some netflix and my mom got tired so she went upstairs. We kinda sticked around a little longer than my mom told us too, and we kissed. We went upstairs only for her to come into my room (she had her own room and own bed to sleep in) and lay on my bed. I put myself next to her, we lied there for 5 mins when we started kissing again. (I'm thinking about it now and it's really fucked up, I kissed my stepsister basically) It was awkward when we saw eachother again the day after, and a week later when I saw her again, we basically said nothing to eachother. I asked her what was going on. She bluntly said:\"There's nothing between us. \"I'm there sitting in my couch, staring at my phone and I'm like: what?\" I told her I thought that kiss meant something. She said she had kissed a guy the other night, maybe even more bluntly than before. Now I don't know what to do at all. I kinda want to tell her to fuck off, she should've told me earlier that this was just one of her \"many\" kisses. But the problem is, there's a very big chance she'll be my fucking sister for the rest of my life. Now I'm basically regretting everything I did. I'm thinking about how I could've spent the time with her, seeing a girl that actually wanted to be in a relationship with me. Now I'm basically lost for words because I've had somebody tell me before that they didn't like me and I just told them to politely fuck off. But I feel like I can't do that now because she's my sister. What should I do? I'm lost. If you've read this far, thank you for doing so and if you reply, a thousand thanks too.",

One is a guy friend thats actually been basically my bff for 6 years, we're both current seniors, the other is a girl we met at the beginning of hs through a stem program and swim. For my FR year and some of SO year i had a crush on her friend and tried to have her set me up without much luck, towards the end of SO year i had a relationship that turned sour but she took my side over my ex's even with them being close friends. Pretty much ever since then ive thought of her as almost a sister because she supports me so much but i also found that she is one of my favorite people to be around and developed a crush on her. For too long to remember in this friendship ive denied any feelings knowing that i should see her as only my friend. Even if i thought otherwise i dont know how it would affect us as a group, they are my rock keeping me from depression most days and if i tried to date her it could ruin everything. She may so no and i rely on my best friend for the time being, or she may say she shares feelings and my best friend resents me for ruining the trio, which would fuck up even more things since our parents are planning a triple graduation party for us. And even if that doesnt happen, what if my best friend also had feelings for her. But even if it all works out, i know she has plans after graduating, and they don't involve staying in state near us for college. Im at a loss for ideas and another day idk what to do is one where i wish i knew how they feel about me.",

Two weeks ago my mum and I had to go to counselling which ended in them signing me up for something called CAMHS. This Wednesday I have to go again I'm so scared of whats going to happen. I don't want people to know why I was at the hospital or why I'm going again and since one of my closet friends is my cousin I'm afraid of her finding out and telling people. I'm scared incase I get treated differently, when I moved to that school I made a friend who was really nice but I started to realise she treats me like a kid, she says \"Okay?\" at the end of everything as if I won't understand and other stuff like that. I don't want anyone else to treat me like that. I also don't know whats going to happen in these visits nobody really tells me, I'm always scared incase they bring out medication or lock me in a room somewhere. I'm a very emotional and sensitive person, I'm always scared of something bad happening and it terrifies me every time my mum or literally anyone questions my mental health. I had a small panic attack when I got there and since I really don't know what is happening this time I'm scared of a big one happening.  \n\n\nMy school attendance is almost at 30% which is really really bad, I struggle to force myself up every morning to the point where it doesn't even happen I just lay there trying to convince myself its worth it.

I have friends at my new school, but I donÃ¢??t know what to do. Ultimately, the decision is mine to make and itÃ¢??s so much pressure. I want to stay with my friends, but maybe this new school could help me? And what if the new school doesnÃ¢??t help? IÃ¢??m just all alone without my best friends since elementary school?",

Anyway, last week I told my friend that I like her boyfriend but I made it perfectly clear that I would never make a move on him, flirt with him, or do anything to get in between them because I respect their relationship. I thought it wasnÃ¢??t a big deal to tell her and I didnÃ¢??t know that she was going to react the way she did. So it turns out that she got mad, and she hates me now and she even told people which makes me upset because I thought that would be something that would just be between her and I. And many people are making a huge deal about it and are mad at me which is freaking me out because I never met to hurt anyone. Now I feel like I bad person and I just want to hear your guyÃ¢??s opinion on this and maybe make me feel better about this situation because I canÃ¢??t stop thinking about it. Thank you!",

SheÃ¢??s been through a lot and she does drugs and sheÃ¢??s not a virgin. IÃ¢??ve hated myself my whole life. Today was actually a really personal day. I spent the whole day with her usually me and her. She gave me my first kiss. Biggest problem is she wants to just be friends with benefits. SheÃ¢??s also bi, so that doesnÃ¢??t help. I knew she was talking to some guy but I donÃ¢??t think I deserve to get hurt like that. I did tell her that if she isnÃ¢??t mine fully that I donÃ¢??t even want to be around her because that shitÃ¢??ll hurt me worse than how I am right now. I deeply care about her. If she gave me the chance IÃ¢??m sure I could be there for her ways that no one else has. She doesnÃ¢??t have the same feelings that I do ofc. I feel crazy when I think about her. Again she was my crush for 4 years and I never said a thing. Despite of all of those red flags I still love her. I just donÃ¢??t want to be hurt. Right now I canÃ¢??t stop thinking about her so IÃ¢??m typing this at 3 AM",

They even went to Mexico to visit some of my and cousins family and didnÃ¢??t even invite me.

When I first became friends with Ella she was this super sweet, funny and witty girl whom I just really liked. But as I spent more time with her I started noticing how sheÃ¢??d get annoyed whenever I was hang out with other people. SheÃ¢??d make it obvious that she was angry at us whenever we hung out with someone else or whenever I hung out with the other girl in our friend group (letÃ¢??s call her Anne) and the next day Ella would act mad at us. ItÃ¢??s like everytime I make a a new friend she find something she can pick at so IÃ¢??ll stop being friends with that person. Ella always talks about how sheÃ¢??s the Ã¢??most disliked person of the friend groupÃ¢?? when Anne and I really do everything we can to please her and keep her happy. Ella talks so openly about how much she hated me and how dumb she thought I was and how boring I am and acts like itÃ¢??s all funny. I auditioned to go to my dream school and told her how excited I was, the only thing she could talk about is how if I got in I would be leaving her a few months before she moved and how I was Ã¢??abandoningÃ¢?? her for some other school. She was so happy when she heard I didnÃ¢??t get in the school. Ella would point out things she hated that people did and then state how I did it. I tried to leave the friendship once and just hung out with other people for a day while she was giving me death stares and she started crying so the counsellor had to get involved and I had to lie about why I was hanging out with other people and say I was just hanging out with other people rather than I was trying to get out of this toxic friendship. She brings that up all the time and talks about how sheÃ¢??ll never forgive me for that when sheÃ¢??s hurt me so many more times and I just pretend it never happened and that IÃ¢??m completely fine. Every fight weÃ¢??ve had sheÃ¢??s started, every fight is always about how sheÃ¢??s dissatisfied with me and I always apologise for it and tell her I wonÃ¢??t hang out with that person again and IÃ¢??ll make sure to not sit or hang out with other people at lunch. Ever since IÃ¢??ve been friends with her every time I hang out with someone else (despite asking her if she wants to come along to) we have a fight every time from her thinking I prefer them over her. I only sit with her and Anne at lunch now. ItÃ¢??s mentally draining being friends with her and being her Ã¢??therapistÃ¢??, having be there for her 24\/7 and having to listen to her talk bad about me to my face and apologising to her. Every time we hang outside of school IÃ¢??m always upset. My family is so tired for me and just wants me to leave the friendship. TheyÃ¢??ve tried telling me what I can do but nothing really works, I canÃ¢??t speak to them about her anymore because they just donÃ¢??t want to hear about her. And itÃ¢??s so confusing because she can be so sweet and funny and happy and I think about how I could ever want to leave this friendship but then the next day she just starts a fight with me for no reason. I want to go to the school counsellor but IÃ¢??m scared the counsellorÃ¢??s gonna confront Ella about it and EllaÃ¢??s gonna spread lies and make everyone hate me. So for right now, IÃ¢??m just waiting till she leaves this school. SheÃ¢??s leaving in about 4-5 months. Her family tells me theyÃ¢??re gonna make sure to keep in contact and have me visit them whenever I get the chance to. I donÃ¢??t know what to do anymore. Please help me",

  "Post": "I need advice on guys. Recently I went to Canada to go and visit family friends with my mom and my brother. There are three guys and they have always acted like cousins to us. One guy who is 19 has always been close to me IÃ¢??m 15. During winter break me and him were watching Netflix in a twin bed and he put his arm around me. After he put his arm around me and my mom walked into the room and yelled at us on how this is not lady like on my behalf. She left the room and later I pause the movie because of the awkward tension between us. My mom pulled him aside without me knowing and asked him if he liked me. He said he didnÃ¢??t know his feelings towards me in that way. The next day at night he asked my brother if he wanted to watch TV. My brother said no because he was tired so when the 19-year-old walked past me I suggested we could watch Netflix. Earlier that day it was his birthday and he got a new phone. So I said I could help him set it up before we watch Netflix. I sat on his bed waiting for him to get changed into comfy clothes in the bathroom. After a while everyone in the house fell sleep and I asked him if we were still going to watch Netflix. He said yes and put on a new movie for us to watch. We watched the hunger games. His arm was uncomfortable so I suggested he put his arm around me. He sat there for a while and I told him I wanted snacks. I told him to come with me because I had to walk all the way downstairs and it was dark. After we got snacks we went upstairs and he sat on the inside of the bed closest to the wall and he got mad because heÃ¢??s bigger than me. I told him that I should lay on the outside because I was gonna go to bed soon. When he went to lay on the inside of the bed he put his arm on the pillow. So when I would lay down his arm would be behind me. He put his arm around me without asking me. After 10 minutes he slid his arm down my waist and kept it there. I put my head on his chest and we watched the movie for an hour. I got tired and suggested that I should go to bed. He told me that I should stay longer because we were both comfortable. I told him I had to go to bed because I was tired and we were gonna wake up early the next day to hang out with family. When I went back to my room I did not know what just happened. The next night he asked me if I wanted to watch Netflix. At this point I do not know if he likes me or not because I didnÃ¢??t think anyone would act this way towards someone they donÃ¢??t like. He had his arm around my waist. We were comfortable with each other. Expected that I was most likely going to go to bed and he wouldnÃ¢??t argue for me to stay longer. I went to bed at 3 AM and we both had to wake up at 8 AM to go skiing. While we were skiing I fell down and he picked me up. To make sure I wouldnÃ¢??t fall down again he put his arm around my waist. He asked me if I wanted to do it an all nighter. He later fell asleep because he was tired from skiing all day. I woke him up and asked if he still wanted to watch Netflix and he said yes. He later fell asleep. The next day I told him why didnÃ¢??t he stay awake so we can watch Netflix because it was my last night there. He said I was supposed to wake him up again and got mad at me. The day we went skiing was my last day in Canada and I was leaving the next day so it was our last chance to cuddle and watch Netflix. I like him and I donÃ¢??t know if he likes me back IÃ¢??m scared to tell him how I feel if he doesnÃ¢??t like me back. Do you guys think he likes me or not?",

  "Post": "So IÃ¢??ll add a little bit of background info for this one, last night (when IÃ¢??m writing this) I was at my best friends house for a sleepover, 2 of our other best friends were there aswell, IÃ¢??ll change their names up for this story, so thereÃ¢??s me, Danielle (thatÃ¢??s my real name btw haha) IÃ¢??m bisexual, thereÃ¢??s Heather, Skoliosexual (possibly pansexual sheÃ¢??s still figuring stuff out) then thereÃ¢??s Melanie and Katelyn they arenÃ¢??t interested in dating and find it disgusting (IÃ¢??ve asked if theyÃ¢??re asexual but they claim they arenÃ¢??t) anyway we had a sleepover last night at Heathers house and me and Heather we have quite a lot in common and she was one of the people who I told first after me and my first girlfriend got together and broke up so me and her are really close. We have this inside joke that weÃ¢??re married to each other (weird I know Ã°???Ã°???) and at this sleepover we were kinda like flirting a little but then we were hugging and in the background Melanie and Katelyn were playing some kinda cheesy love songs in my opinion haha, and me and Heather were lying down on the mattress while like hugging up with each other and then I thought about and lesbian mini movie I saw on YouTube were something kinda similar to this happened and I pointed it out, and then Katelyn brung up something that happened at a sleepover about 7-8 months ago (IÃ¢??ve known Katelyn since the beginning of primary school) where I kissed another girl and sung Ã¢??I kissed a girlÃ¢?? after it as a joke (I hadnÃ¢??t come out of the closet yet so the girl I kissed didnÃ¢??t know I was bisexual, to be fair I kinda thought I was straight at the time) and then Melanie told Heather Ã¢??I think you should kiss DanielleÃ¢?Â and put on Ã¢??I kissed a girlÃ¢?? and then Heather said she had cherry chapstick as a joke and then she put it on, then it was at the first Ã¢??I kissed a girl and I liked itÃ¢?Â and me and Heather kissed, but since I was nervous I came in too aggressively she told me to do it again and then we ended up doing it again and again til the song was over . But it was moving so so quickly like I was on top of Heather, she was on top of me it was, amazing. So amazing we ended up doing it with the song on all over again. It was one of the best parts of the night haha (IÃ¢??m such a horny spaz..) but after I was red as a tomato, Melanie was crying, Katelyn and Melanie were pretty grossed out (theyÃ¢??re not homophobic just grossed out by dating in general) and then Melanie was like Ã¢??I didnÃ¢??t think youÃ¢??d actually do it!Ã¢?Â And then it kinda all came to me\nÃ¢??I think I like HeatherÃ¢?Â \nbut then later Katelyn told me that Heather said she wasnÃ¢??t into it (I highly think she was because after it she pinned me down on the bed Ã°???Ã°???) and my heads been messed up all day because of it, like I donÃ¢??t know if I should ask out Heather, if I should just try not to think of it but, itÃ¢??s been really hard \nWhat should I do?\n\nEDIT: So I asked Heather a little while ago how she felt when we kissed and she wasnÃ¢??t into it Ã°???:( but IÃ¢??m over it now, I got a new girlfriend a little over a week ago and Heathers still one of my best friends so itÃ¢??s all worked out well Ã°???",

My best friend decided to distance himself from our group a while back and none of us understood why he would do that just to try to get girls and be popular. He was the best looking out of us and now that he distanced himself he had girls craving for him and now he has a girlfriend and is happy. Since highschool is going by fast I'm starting to realize that I want what he has and I see the problem. However I don't know if I should distance myself from them just to change who I am. I want to keep close bonds with my friends but if I do distance myself they won't like me as much.

  "Post": "Hi reddit! This is my first post, so I hope the formatting is ok, but here's my story\n\n\nI'm the oldest of six (F17, almost 18) and the things that have happened in my house recently are pushing me towards leaving.\n\n\nThis started back in early 2018 when my parents took my phone and found out that I'm bi. They took my phone away for a year, screamed at me for hours, set content blocks and DSNs, and then said nothing about it for about two years.\n\n\nFinally got my phone back just over a year ago and they still try to check\/take it regularly, but I've been refusing to let them have it, and it's worked well, but I have just short of a panic attack every time mom asks.\n\n\nFlash forward to the day before New years, a few days ago at the time that I'm writing this. My mom yelled at me for turning off my phone every time she walks in the room (a coping mechanism that I learned after the last time they took it away), told me that she refuses to pay for a phone plan (the only reason I have one is for driving because I have a poor sense of direction, and so I can call for help if I get stuck somewhere, and I have been trying to use it to get a job, to pay for said plan, car insurance, save up for college {something I don't want, but they do}, and move out). And told me that I was a sinner and evil and going to hell because she thought I was dating a \"girl\" (one of my non binary friends).\n\n\nSo I've about had it and I want to leave, but I don't know what to do or how to pull it off without ending up dead or something. I have a plan to try and leave on the 21 of Jan, but if things get worse sooner, I might have to speed it up.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEDIT: As of today, Jan 5th, I have decided that I will leave and I'm going to do it next week. I'm going to try living with my friend that I mentioned earlier. Thank you all for your kind words, it really means a lot to me!",

I like the color black and I guess that is a problem for most others not sure why. I have a crush on this girl but I know she doesnÃ¢??t like me back. The only times she has acknowledged me is just to say hi because she has to be my partner. The problem with my home life is that I was expected to even as little kid to be the saving grace of my family. I was supposed to be the smart one and pass all of school work with flying colors. My dad and mom are divorced and constantly trying to dish out dirt on each other. Another problem is that I have a very big anger problem itÃ¢??s not uncontrollable itÃ¢??s just that if I get mad enough IÃ¢??ll start yelling and crying and punch shit until I calm down. My family thinks poorly of me because of it and my mother has told that one day when they were talking (my parents) my dad said that he was worried I was going to be a school shooter. I cried over that because I thought I knew my dad but I know he said that for a damn fact even if it was from my mom. I depresses me thinking about the different possibilities as to why people donÃ¢??t like me or acknowledge me. My brother also hated my guts when we were kids and would constantly bully me and try to make me look bad in front of everyone that we knew. These things have gotten to me so much that the main reason I think people even try to be nice to me is because they think IÃ¢??m going to shoot up the school and they donÃ¢??t to be target caught in the crosshairs.

A lot of people think I am religious but I am not I donÃ¢??t pray and I donÃ¢??t really follow most of the rules. I am not one of the hijab is that takes it off and on I just keep it on all of the time. And my problem is that the hijab for me was something that I was proud of that I loved and I used to feel like it didnÃ¢??t restrict me, but know I still love wearing it. I am just sick of having to restrict my self from dressing the way I wanna dress, cause I have a berry curvy body so when i just wanna wear a top and jeans it looks to provocative. Another thing is that I would like to go to clubs and party(not drink) just party without people judging me. I used to feel free in my hijab but now I just feel like I am suffocating. And my parents donÃ¢??t care if I take it off or not it just that I have been wearing it for so long that itÃ¢??s so hard to stop and I am so scared that some people will look at me and see a failure. And a part of me wanna keep it on but another part of me donÃ¢??t want to. I donÃ¢??t really feel like I canÃ¢??t be myself, I have felt like this in 4 years just hoping it will go away. I just donÃ¢??t know what i should do please donÃ¢??t judge me.",

  "Post": "So I obviously need some advice. The advice I need is on how to bring up a question, and ask said question.\n\nI need help on how to bring up and ask the question of, can my best female friend and I fly to a different state that's a while away alone (without an adult) to meet an online friend of mine. I know this sounds pretty sketchy but for some background I will include the following paragraph.\n\nI met him online playing video games. We ended up talking and what not. We've been talking for a couple months now. I think of him as my bestest friend, someone closer then all of my other friends. We both really want to meet each other. He's a minor like myself and our age difference is very small. I know for a fact that he is a minor, not some older man pretending to be a teenager. The reason we haven't meet up is because of the large distance between us.\n\nSo that's the background. I already accounted for the cost of plane tickets, baggage, someone to go with, and a public place to meet. I will be paying for the whole trip for myself and my friend so my mother won't have to spend a penny on it. We're only going over for a day, and we (my friend and I) will be missing one or two days of school. We would go late one night so we'd get there in the morning then leave that day. We will be meeting at a very public place with tons of people. He might be bringing male friends as well. \n\nJust for the record because I feel like this will go along with what my mother will say, I am a responsible person. I act mature, never get in trouble, get good grades, ect. So if that helps any it's there. \n\nAlso an extra question that I haven't quite thought out. My friend and I are legally allowed to fly alone but need a guardians signature. How would I do that on a round trip?\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thank you.",

  "Post": "I am an Asian-American born in California to a family that lives comfortably. My mom works in cosmetology and has gotten an associates degree, but she doesn't use it. My father has a bachelors that he also doesn't use due to working the family business. Both parents have split, but both still want \"the best for me\". I never got the option to explore careers growing up. I was told I was to be a doctor from ages 5-12 and from 12 to now I'm being told that I'm to be a surgeon. Of course \"I get to\" specialize in whatever I want. I've gone through phases of straight out telling them that I don't want to be a doctor (ages 9-12) and then accepting it due to the fact that I don't have any other idea of what I wanted. I'm the stereotypical perfect Asian-American daughter with a 4.4*\/3.9 GPA at the top 5% of her class. I am on a varsity sports team and have done leadership activities like ASB and councils. I work a summer job and have been saving up for a while just incase. \n\nI've always known in my heart that this dream of me isn't what I want to do but my parents want of me. Frankly, I'm tired of keeping up this perfect image of myself. I don't want to kill myself all through college for a career I know isn't me. Now here comes the catch. I have a boyfriend whom I love with all my heart. He currently is on the other side of the country since he's graduated early. We've had our ups and downs but I've never met someone as perfect for me as he is. He's coming to visit soon and I honestly cant wait to see him again.\n\nI want to go to college where he is to get a bachelors in nursing or dental hygiene instead of becoming a surgeon, doctor, or whatever. Though it may seem like I'm uprooting my life for a relationship that who knows will last or not, moving away will give me freedom from my parents. I'd be able to pursue these other careers without them micromanaging me and telling me that I'm a disappointment of their ideals of me. I wouldn't be going to a UC... like they'd planned and would be going to either an average state university in his area or a decent private school there. I just dont see the point in going anywhere else and putting us through more long distance than we need to be. We may or may not work out. In the end, I'd have gained freedom, gotten a degree, and have been able to see more of America than I would have been if I didn't. \n\nWhat I'd love is a cozy house to call my own somewhere that's green and away from the city. I'd love to have a family down the road. I'd love to have a stable job that pays just enough for these wants and a little extra for a modest road trip sightseeing maybe once a year. That's what would make me happiest. \n\nThough I'd love if my parents supported me and helped me as if I was doing what they wanted of me, I'm ready to support myself if they don't. I'd get a job, get a loan and some scholarships if possible, and pay my bills while being a full time student. I know I can do it with or without their support in me. \n\nI'm being reasonable right? My biggest fear is wasting my life doing something meaningless to me.",

  "Post": "My brother started molesting me ever since we both were very young. He would insert his fingers inside my vagina and there were instances where he would poke my nipples and stop talking to me\/behave rudely if I didn't let him. I was around 6-7 years old at that point of time and he was three years older to me. Our parents never introduced the concept of consent to us or about sexual abuse, and I do understand now that it was probably just curiosity why he did that. However it didn't end there. When I was in grade 9, (he was in 12, not legally an adult, but 17 years old) one night he squeezed my breasts and asked if he could suck them. I was horrified shocked and said no, shoved him off and went away. He was alarmed that I had reacted that way and asked me not to tell my parents (which implies he knows how wrong it is). After that around 7 years have passed and I have never been able to get it off my mind, he never apologised to me and behaved as if everything was normal. I started distancing myself from him, as well as my family because it was unbearable for me to get compared to him at every step or the other, when I know what an absolute monster he is. One year back I learnt he attempted to molest one of his batchmates when he was drunk. I however have no definite proof of it or have not verified it myself, and only one of his classmates have told me this. A few months back (I am 20 now) I had an ugly altercation with my brother and I ended up calling him out for it in a fit of rage. He apologised and said it was a mistake, however I am not convinced. If it really was a one-time mistake, why would he molest his classmate? It just does not add up to me. I've seen a therapist and even though she was really good, even she tried to coax me to forgive my brother which isn't at all coming from me. She told me \"people make mistakes but people are not their mistakes\". It doesn't make sense to me because even though I agree with her, I think after one point of time there is a clear distinction between a mistake and a choice. I have gathered up enough courage to tell my parents and they are in shock. They are trying to help me out with it, but nothing that they are saying is helping me. He has always been the favourite and always been treated with bias, however I myself do not know what I want out of this. I'm in a huge mess. I do not know whether I will ever be able to even have good connections with my parents because I feel my brother is always in the middle. I cannot bear being close to anyone who is close with my brother. I am posting it here to ask for advice. My father has heart issues and he has taken it very badly and both of them are blaming themselves as failures as parents. My mother thinks it's going to get healed over time and has even gone as far as saying people have it worse than me. I do not know what to feel or say, as I do not believe I am in a competition in who gets abused more. The main thing I am worried about is I'm scared of my brother, because he seems like a psychopath to me. He has terribly strong opinions about woman empowerment, and how strong rape laws should be and he considers himself an all in all feminist and here he is, molesting his own sister. I think he is a potential sex offender and the most ideal thing would be if he would be locked in forever. I do not know how this works together and what really to do at this point of time. It has affected me beyond repair. I have body issies, trust issues and confidence issues simply because of this. I do not know what to do. ",

  "Post": "Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl who had just graduated from a secondary school. I recently finished taking an important exam which majority of 17 year old students have to take. People said that our future is depending on the exam. We'll get good jobs if our results is good. But that is not my concern yet. My concern is that the result will be out around 3 or 4 months after the exam and those months are usually the time when students who took the exam search part time jobs. I would like to experience a part time job myself but my parents are against it. When I asked why, I don't really get a satisfactory response. Some reasons that they mention was how am I going to work everyday (transportation) and I won't even get that much money from working a part time job. They said it's better for me to look for something that I like and build skills from that. For example taking classes, etc. The thing is, those classes require fees and I feel bad to keep asking money from my family. Everytime I want something, I have to ask money from my father or mostly my brother. Of course they'll give it to me but I just can't help but to feel bad for them. The reason why I want to work is because I want to have at least some pocket money that I earned by myself. Maybe in a few months, I will continue my studies in a university and I can't expect my father to pay for all of my expenses. I do think that taking extra class would be nice, I do like arts and I want to learn how to paint but those classes mostly cost a fortune. Actually I have a lot more things to explain but I don't want to make this too lenghty. So, my concern is.. What should I do? Take a class or convince my parents to allow me to get a job? ",

And once they make a connection with someone from that school, they get invited to their personal house parties too.  But i just get so frustrated by that, because no matter how many friends i have at this school, i never get invited to the big parties.  And at my own school i actually am very well-liked, and i do have a few friends at other schools, but they arent the ones that throw the parties.  I used to not care, but now i just feel so alienated.  But then some people actually threw a BIG community-wide, teen-only party that i was actually invited to!  But i kept getting so anxious about it, and everyone was going just to grind and hook-up with girls, and i was really afraid.  So i didnt go.  And whats worse is that i punished myself for my bad decision and kept reliving it like a nightmare in my head.  But then i realized that the real reason that i was turned off by the hooking up and grinding was because i think im gay and i hate it.  Ive always had a kind of attraction towards guys, but i never paid any attention to it.  But now ever since ive been introduced to masturbation and pornography, my same-sex attraction has been more pronounced.  Im only ever attracted to gay porn and i fantasize about sexual encounters with my guy friends.  So now im even more anxious and scared because i dont know anyone who is gay and im worried that it will alienate me even more by the friends i have.  There's really a lot more to this story, and the problems im having now, but ive never been able to get advice about this topic, and i want to keep this post focused on it.  And ive already typed out so much!  So please, i really need some advice in any form, or if you can recommend a better subreddit to post this to.  And if you have a question or need more info, instead of downvoting, you can just ask and ill answer.  thank you!\n\nEDIT: and one more point is that i can't help thinking that what social things that my friends do is the \"right\" thing to do.  I wish that parties wasn't what kids are \"supposed\" to do.  I wish i could tell my friends how i feel, because then they probably would invite me to things and be supportive (at least some of them).  I wish i could grow up and have good experiences and be proud of them.  And most of all, i wish i could accept the fact that im gay, and that there would be people that i would fit in with, and truly feel like a strong part of something good.\n\nIm sorry for being a downer, i just need to get this off my chest because ive held it in for soo long!",

  "Post": "Hello everyone. I've been lurking reddit for a while, and so many stories have inspired me to start posting on here, so here goes.\n\n\nI'm 17\/M, and I have an admitted history of being overly shy when it comes to talking to girls. I have, however worked on this and have mostly overcome this, with a combination of maturing and having supportive friends.\n\n\nI've started to get serious with a few girls before, but have stopped short from dating, mostly because they cut me off before I had a chance to really ask them out, and they would end up dating several guys which have ended up in disaster.\n\n\nNow, I'm a pretty well rounded guy who is both nice and fun, and, not to sound self righteous, I have been told I'm good looking as well. On the flip side though, I take part in rather geeky hobbies, such as gaming, Warhammer 40k table top, and Magic: the gathering, just to name a few. While this hasn't presented itself to be a problem yet, I'm a bit nervous for any future relationships I may get in to. More times than not when I meet a girl, they see the nice, fun, party side of me. However, there is a geeky side to me as well, and I fear that when a girl sees that side, she will no longer be interested in me. \n\n\nIn such a case, I'm probably better off, but on the other hand, this is likely to become a repetitive cycle, seeing as the girls I meet are at social events with friends. I pretty much just want advice on how to handle this sort of situation, if anyone has experience with this sort of thing. \n\n\nTo those who read all of this, you are truly awesome and deserve a cookie. Thanks for reading!",

I don't have a car, but my mother and I are going to the same town the same day because we have an optometrist appointment in the afternoon. She can easily drop me off at my boyfriend's place but she would have nothing to do for the rest of the day\/night while I spend it with him and have dinner with his family. My most convenient ride home would be my dad. He works and commutes in the same city at night, so he can take me back home in the morning. We haven't spoken about it yet, but she said \"Hey I think we need to talk\" so i'm assuming she isn't okay with me sleeping at my boyfriend's...if that's the case she's going to wait and find something she doesn't really need to do until i'm done. That's just illogical, if my dad could easily take me home.\n\nI go to college and am only home for the summer. While in college I had the freedom to make my own decisions based on what I believed was right and wrong without any sort of control from my parents. I believe that it should be okay for me to go stay over at my boyfriends house because (and my parents are aware of these) I went on a lake trip with him and his family and we stayed at their house, I visited my boyfriend just last weekend and wouldn't have stayed anywhere else since I was with him the whole time. I'm 19 and he's 20, we've been dating for about a year now.\n\nHow can I communicate with my mom to get her to understand that though she may not agree that it's okay, she needs to respect my decision? How else can I support my argument?",

Which I know for a fact is all bullshit and crap she made up.\n\nI would ask her simple questions trying to prob this lie in a way like what was her official title and where did she live and what did her castle look like, stuff like that. And you know what she did she would either blatantly avoid the truth or google some image of a palace and call it hers. That type of crap. And then she would go about talking about her mom and all this family stuff which for the most part is her just over exaggerating the story. I have met her mom and she is a really nice although strict lady.\n\nthe truth that I am getting at here is that I have tried all sorts of methods to deliberately remove myself from her but nothing has worked and the only other option I have is just not talking to her which would mean not talking to my actual friends who I enjoy the company of.

  "Post": "so i have this friend and i think our friendship is toxic but iÃ¢??m not 100% sure. HereÃ¢??s our history: \nwe went to elementary school together but we werenÃ¢??t really friends because she was very quiet. However she was best friends with one of my good friends so we were friendly with eachother. We went to different middle schools and I had a huge group of friends and i was very social. I found out that she was transferring to my middle school for seventh grade and i decided to be nice and show her the ropes of the school and walk her to her classes and introduce her to people and let her eat lunch with my friends and i. I remember telling my friends that she would eventually get comfortable and make her own friends. but that never happened, she followed me around for weeks and slowly overtime because a part of our friend group. She wasnÃ¢??t really friends with any of the other girlÃ¢??s though, she was just always with me. we got really close and i really liked her, we were very alike and i was glad that i finally got to know her. Near the end of seventh grade however i realized something. She didnÃ¢??t have 1 single friend that i hadnÃ¢??t introduced her to, she never disagreed with me, and i never hung out with anyone without her anymore. Even my friends that didnÃ¢??t go to our school she would follow me to hang out with them and eventually it just became expected that we came as a pair. Skip 4 years later to sophomore year of high school. My social circle has shrunk immensely and iÃ¢??ve lost the vast majority of my friends. I have about 5 friends but every one of them is friends with this girl too. We are still very very close friends, and she still follows me everywhere, texts me all the time (a bit obsessively) and inserts herself into any relationship i make. Most people at our school will only hang out with both of us not just one of us because we are always together. One of my friends wonÃ¢??t talk to me anymore because we used to be really close but after this girl convinced our guidance counselor to switch her into all my classes my whole life was consumed by her and i didnÃ¢??t talk to that friend as much. I donÃ¢??t get lunch with other people because once i did and she texted me long paragraphs about how she felt like i didnÃ¢??t want to have lunch with her and like i was excluding her. She didnÃ¢??t have any friends that she had made on her own until this year. Now she has a few friends that she did make on her own and that iÃ¢??m not super good friends with and iÃ¢??m grateful for that but now iÃ¢??m stuck because i donÃ¢??t have a life outside of her and when i think about my life before she came to my school compared to my life now i am so isolated. She encourages all of my bad descions and still has never once disagreed with anything i have said. she invited herself to everytbing i do and follows me and itÃ¢??s like i canÃ¢??t have a conversation with someone without her barging in or just standing there listening. I am scared that i will eventually not even have shared friends with her and i will have 0 friends except for her. What do i do? How do i make real friendships with people that arenÃ¢??t a three way friendship including her? how do i become less close with her so my whole life isnÃ¢??t consumed by her",

  "Post": "\n\nIt was autumn, october, everything was new for me expect my best friend, at least I had her among those people I didnÃ¢??t know. \n\nI really wasnÃ¢??t planning on starting to like someone, to have a crush on someone. Mainly because the guy i liked for years hurted me to the point I never want to feel love again. \n\nOne day my best friend told me about this guy( lets call him John). Now my best friend knew John as a really nice and shy guy. She thought itÃ¢??d be really good if I started to like someone whoÃ¢??s worth it and wouldnÃ¢??t be like the past guy.\n\nIn the beginning I wasnÃ¢??t interested in him at all, I began to see him every day, every time I would go out and slowly without noticing I had fallen for him. (Also just to put it out there, we were never friends and still are not.)\n\nNow I told my best friend that I started to like him and she was happy because she had hopes that heÃ¢??s a good person, I also told two other friend about him. Now lets name this other two friends Lola and Laura. \n\nMe and Lola would kinda be goofy around him because thatÃ¢??s just how I was around my friends and I didnÃ¢??t want to act different just because I liked John or to impress him( being goofy sometimes around him also doesnÃ¢??t mean that I was goofing around laughing loudly or talking loudly, basically doing something to get his attention). When I would get jealous Lola would go to John and just look at him angry, also she would call my name every time she saw him. \n\nIn the other side my cousin had a friend who knew John so I immediately told my cousin to ask her friend what kind of person was John,(lets name my cousins friend Pete). \n\nPete told my cousin that John wasnÃ¢??t a good person he was kind of an asshole and very selfish, and that I wouldnÃ¢??t be his type mainly because IÃ¢??m not the type of girl to dress those fancy dresses and go to the club every friday. The description that Pete gave my cousin was very very different from what my best friend thought John was, and that was immediately a turn off lets say for me. \nI tried to forget him because I wasnÃ¢??t prepared to be hurt more just like the last time. \n\nNow a year has past and John never looked at me last year, maybe sometimes. Now everytime we run into each-other he just stares at me, also we have sport class together, and he always looks at me, my friends always catch him staring at me. \n\nMy question is: Why is he looking at me ?Is it because of the things my friend would do in front of him or he just stares at me without a reason? I know this was long but I wanted an advice from someone who might maybe know the real answer and can help me so I donÃ¢??t have to haunt my self with those thoughts anymore.",

But we still had practically no contact apart from the occasional look from across the classroom. But a month ago we went to a party. I was drunk she wasnÃ¢??t she doesnÃ¢??t really like it when I drink but when I stared getting less and less drunk we just relaxed on the bed for 2 hours with her head on my shoulder the entire time. ThatÃ¢??s when we started texting and sending pictures and such. But the day after she told my friend she just wanted to be friends. Which I found out today. But thatÃ¢??s the confusing part she always asks the teacher if I can sit with her in math class. We get a private room because we both blow ass in math. In the the break we sit on a couch and she is always all over me. With her legs over mine we also hold each otherÃ¢??s hands a little awkwardly for example she takes my hand says Ã¢??wow your hands are much bigger than mineÃ¢?Â than just holds my hand for a few minutes. She asked me if I just liked her or Ã¢??lovedÃ¢?Â her I said I loved her (love in my language is basically the best translation but it isnÃ¢??t that big of a deal as it is in other places like America) then she sent this string of emojis Ã°???Ã°?Â¤Â­Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â. We always talk about having a movie marathon together. She is usually the one that brings it up. I always say she can come whenever she wants. She says she will come over when she comes home from her vacation. So thatÃ¢??s pretty nice. But we had a small argument about a week ago about my snusing habits which is basically a small package of nicotine you put in your lip. It is basically the same as smokes but with out the lung cancer and the awful smell. She said if I ever did it she would never be my friend again. Of course my friends told me to tell her because she would find out eventually so I told her. She said we could still be friends and that she was joking. But she was mad at me so I told her IÃ¢??ll give her space. Which she didnÃ¢??t want but I said I didnÃ¢??t wanna talk if your just gonna send pictures of your roof thatÃ¢??s when she said OKAY I AM NOT MAD AT YOU. Which practically reverted everything to normal. And we started talking 24\/7 again. So do you guys think she likes me or just playing with me?\n\nshe has never been in any serious relationship. Neither have I\n\nshe told me about a dream where she kissed a stranger once. She sort of inclined it was me\n\nshe has never kissed anyone. She did watch a Netflix movie where someone kissed and said omg so cute their kissing then I asked who. Then she said Ã¢??you and meÃ°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã‚Â» \n\nI left her on read once so she started started spamming the Ã¢??all I wantÃ¢?Â song from Olivia Rodriguez and stated it was literally her love life on private snap story. Which is like a half sad love song\n\nWeÃ¢??re both 15. I am male sheÃ¢??s female \n\nTl;dr. Told girl I liked her while drunk. Girl tells friends she only wants to be friends but she send all signs she likes me. Texting, constant looks, really touchy, had her head on my shoulder for 2 hours straight, constantly talks about wanting to have a movie marathon",

  "Post": "So I really feel in an empty space right now, let me tell you the reason why: So I met this girl in school and we just met on social media and texted and stuff. Then we actually started meeting in passing periods, whatever time we had, we used, we had so many jokes and fun with eachother. We passed so many notes and made weird eye contact that also made us laugh. The thing is that we were never able to talk to eachother much because the closer we became, the more shy I got. By a year or so, I was barely able to even sit by her at a table without holding my breath because of how shy i was. As you already figured, ive caught feelings. I was better off like this, having friends and crushes, as i would not be ready to have a date and take on that responsibility at that time. And as dumb as i was, another girl came up and i instantly got attached to her, our friendship eventually disappeared, we just texted for homework help which we do partly now, but after i started dating this other girl i knew i couldnt be responsible. I broke up with her so she could find better people then me. So these days at school, we still make eye contact somehow where ever i look, its never the same because we just look. Every corner i look at i always make eye contact with her. I miss those times, where we would just be buddies til the end. I want to build that bond back, but my shy self wont let me. All i can do is look and see her everywhere. I feel that ive receded in life back to when i met her, but shes no longer the person i see in passing peiod talking to me and waving. We always high fived, and i wish we could go back in time. But it always leads back to her. No, im not planning to date her, i just want to start over and become best friends with her again. someday ill gain the guts to actually be the person to high five her, as shes the person who usually does it. Though it may seem little, it goes a long way for this guy. I really want this friendship back, without it, im sitting in sand, trying to get her off my mind, finding hobbies so i could do it, but it all leads back to her. I tell you this story so i dont die of holding this thought in every second of the day. to her even though she wont see it: im sorry that i was so why not being able to talk to you when i had the chance, i wish i could fix that from the start i met you. thanks. im sorry if i hopped to random topics that you couldnt understand.",

All of us had taken a few sips of alcohol (but we were not completely drunk as we could perfectly function normally), we all decided to lie down on a couch. My best friend and I sitting beside each other and the boy laying on his stomach on top of both our legs. We stayed like that for a few minutes until I begin to feel the boy place his hand on my leg, at first at didnÃ¢??t think it was a problem until he began to squeeze and move up and down my leg. Since itÃ¢??s been going on for about 5mins he then asked what his limit was, referring to how high up his hand can go and what areas he couldnÃ¢??t touch. This kept going for about 25mins. At times I would take his hand lower if I felt uncomfortable. During this time I tried to get my mind off it by using my phone. It wasnÃ¢??t until he left when I really thought about it and there is now this uncomfortable feeling in my chest that wonÃ¢??t go away and I suddenly felt scared. While it was happening I thought I was okay with it but now I realize that IÃ¢??m not and IÃ¢??m afraid if he tells anyone. IÃ¢??m not the kind of person whom would do something like this as it was my first time having someone touch me like that, and if word comes out IÃ¢??m afraid to explain myself (IÃ¢??m not quite social). IÃ¢??m mad at myself for not saying how I felt, but at the time I thought it was okay despite feeling a little uncomfortable (I was confused I guess). He also hugged me from the back for about 5mins and would place his hand on my breast and I had to push his hand away a few times. He did say Ã¢??you do realize where my hand is at right?Ã¢?Â and still continue to leave it there but I still didnÃ¢??t say anything and only push it away. I have also been talking about it with my best friend but I need more advice, specifically from people who have experienced something similar.",

  "Post": "I am 17 years old bisexual male, although nobody knows that. I have never before thought of having a relationship with girls, and especially not with boys, because I don't feel like it's right thing for me to do, I just can't commit. I prefer women by far, but there are exceptions. But anyway that's not the point.\n\nIn my class there are only 3 boys including me,and 17 girls. It has become obvious to me that the girls adore me, they always call me hot, sexy, beautiful... They would sometimes even slap my butt, or grab my nipples. One girl does that all the time, let's call her Kate. On numerous occasions they told me that I am the hottest guy in school, which I find very flattering, but i don't belive in that. \n\nI flirt with all of the girls, that's just the way i am. Anyway a couple of them asked me out, but I rejected them. They are pretty, really pretty, but I just don't want a relationship. I don't know how and why. We always talk about sex, correction they. I kinda find it upsetting. \n\nOne day we got so horny that we created a sex grupe on messenger. 8 girls and me. We talked for a couple of days about all the nasty things. And Kate asked me, so when will we fuck? I answered something like: Whenever you want, baby.it was a joke, more or less. So she said right now. I said i can't, let's do it after the school. I still didn't believe that it would happen. \n\nAfter the school I, Kate and 2 other girls went to the Kate's house . They were her Bffs. I thought it was a joke, who wouldn't? Two of the girls had boyfriends(including Kate), and i just couldn't believe. When we finally came, we sat down on the couch. I had a shot, and then they started touching my legs, i got aroused ,and so it began. 3 girls were giving me a blowjob, fucking unbelievable. Then after 10 m, Kate and her friend started striping . While one didn't one to do it, because of her \"boyfriend\"(she probably didn't want to lose her virginity like that, or something) other's took of their tops and pants . I still can't believe how beautiful Kate is, she was the other girl that had a boyfriend. Also she was a virgin. After an hour of the good stuff, we went home. \n\nKate from then on always insists for as to go on a date, but i just cant. She touches me all the time, it's really hard. She still has a 'boyfriend' , so that makes the situation much more difficult. And it also puts me in a weird position. \n\nThere' s also a girl called Z, she always implies how she would love to fuck me, in subtle ways. She is allso from my class. She is in the sex group, but I haven't slept with her. She is the funniest girl i know, but argh... I don't know. \n\nThere's alsso Mary, she thinks that i love her. But that can't be further from the truth. We have been flirting online for about a couple of months, i only flirt to flirt. She sad that she loved me, and it makes me sad. I once sand a shirtless pick , and she sand me nudes. She is Austria now, sooo.... She is in love, and i don't want to break her hart, but i must. \n\n\nAlso i have a feeling in my gut that my friend for another class may like me. He always touches my shoulder, arms and back. He could be just friendly, but what do i know? He is hot for sure, but i don't want to ruin our current relationship. And also i don't want people to know that for me. \n\nFor the end i have a couple of girls(who i don't even know) writing to me all sorts of stuff,but all they really want is to date. And i don't. I went so far with one of them(girl from neighborhood), that we slept together, we never dated. And there's this guy Nash. He is from a foreign country , i have been talking him.I don't know him, but he always asks me weird questions. He is gay for sure,really gay. I'll probably block him.\n\nSo, what should i do? Should I date one of them, and if so who? I am really afraid of getting in a relationship\/s, I just don't see myself in one. I feel like i can't commit, and will break somebody's hart.

  "Post": "Ever since I was little like 4ish years old I felt like my parents were starting to abuse my sister and I. Like it was only from time to time and it was also during a time where my father was becoming successful. As years went on I found that my parents would shake, hit, and yell at my sister and I whenever we made small mistakes. We would sometimes get bigger punishments if we made bigger mistakes. I remember one situation when I was about 5-6, my sister forgot a iPad in an airplane and we realized this when we were home. My dad said he would pick it up but he was angry. The next day during breakfast I forgot what was going on because I was focused on counting the cereal in my bowl but my mom kicked one of the legs on my sisters chair causing her to fall backwards. She stood up and started screaming at me. I immedientley froze, my vision blurred, and the words she was screaming just sounded muffled. However, I was scared to death. We went to school and when our mom picked us up she apologized. The same behavior went on and then when I reached 2nd grade everything changed. My parents got a divorce. I remember my dad walked into my room and asked me, \"Would you be mad if I left for a little bit came back?\" I figured that if he left for a little bit that meant it would just be a couple hours, I thought he was just gonna go to work. He left the room, packed his bags, and I didn't see him for a couple months. After a couple days, I decided that my dad had went on a trip. During those days my mom would forget to feed my sister and I. We kind of just sat in our room and watched minecraft videos or whatever. After, more days passed we would hear our mom crying. Sometimes she would get up storm into our room and yell at us saying that the divorce was our fault. When I finally saw my dad he took us to a party. It was somewhere in Beverly Hills. Full of rich Hollywood people with 20 year old wives. He had got his own too, a girlfriend who was about 13 years younger than him. It upset me that my dad moved on so fast and at first he didn't even tell me that he was dating her. Until like 5 months later when I asked if they were dating. He never even told me they got married. For the next couple of years my mom would talk about how my dad is going to abandon my sister and I and start another family. I heard those words constantly and my mom saying she was the only one who we actually had. When we did visit our dad, every other weekend. It would usually be him talking about how our mom was crazy and him just yelling at us at the top of his lungs. He even showed us his divorce records and whatever and told us our mom said he was physically and emotionally abusive. He told us she lied, I didn't believe it though. My dad has always been a violent person. Last year, I kind of got fed up with my dad and the way he treated me and lied, so I called CPS. I stayed at my mom's house. My mom is a caring person but she sometimes confuses me. Whenever I make a mistake she tells me she's going to drive me straight to my dad's house and drop me off there, she yells insults saying I'm a liar, terrible daughter, a bad kid, how she sometimes wished I was dead, and etc. She occasionally will physically abuse me and when she does it can get pretty scary. I got diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety and I have kind of used drugs to help me escape, which I know is unhealthy. I have an amazing social life and friends I love, but my mom rarely lets me have plans. I feel so alone, I have zero trust for any of my parents. I trust my sister but she's usually on her computer or at my dad's. I've had suicidal thoughts but I know I wouldn't do that, the thought of what happens after scares me. Staying at my mom's house is really tiring but I'd much rather stay here than my dad's. Me staying at my mom's means I get blamed for everything, go through constant emotional and mental abuse, and will sometimes be physically abused. My mom doesn't realise her mistakes, refuses to admit her abusive behavior, and we always get in fights. I don't know what to do, I've considered running away but I don't know if it's worth it. I love all my friends and I do still care about my mom. I won't ever forgive her or forget what she did and still does do but she has helped me in so many ways. She helped me find a place to stay after I called CPS on my dad and had nowhere to stay since she was in NY for a bit with my sister. She cares about my health and everything. I just don't really know how I feel about her. I just know the place I'm at right now just makes me miserable. I've tried antidepressants and therapy and both didn't work. I just keep feeling like I'm getting worse. I know I have a good life, I have a good education, a roof over my head, clothes, food, and other basic needs. I just feel like hearing all those words and insults at a super young age really traumatized me and whenever I hear it again from my mom or Dad I freak out. Whenever I look at my mom I just feel unsafe and mad. Both of my parents didn't really make an effort to be emotionally here for my sister and I and both didn't really want to help us with making food or teaching us important life lessons. I kind of grew up feeling like I was more independent than a lot of other people that I personally know my age. I was always kind of jealous of people who could depend on their parents. I've tried talking about how I feel with my mom and she just yells at me and tries to convince me that I'm crazy and how I should be normal. I feel like I can't keep living the way I do. I have no one to talk to and I am so depressed.\n\nIs running away worth it? Should I get an emancipation? Where would I even go if I ran away? Will I feel even more alone? Will my depresssion get worse or better? I really don't know. This is just me being completely honest please just let me know what you think.",

Anyways:\nI dated this guy for a short period of time (not even a full year) but we were really close friends prior to our dating.  I was absolutely in love with him, and I would say he was definitely my best friend. And he felt the same, or at least he said he did. But I completely fucked it up. I have a lot that is wrong with me, extreme depression and anxiety, abandonment issues , borderline personality disorder, you know the type. And this caused me to be really distant and confusing in our relationship. No matter how much I told myself that he loved me, my brain told me that I could never be loved. Even though i knew that he only had feelings for me, i was extremely, extremely jealous of everyone he talked to, not just girls, all of his friends, boys included.Thats not to say he was a saint, but IÃ¢??m almost positive that most of our problems stemmed from my insecurities. But I can genuinely say that i was in the worst place when we dated. But now im not. And neither is he. And i feel like an absolute fool for wasting my chance with the guy of my dreams. Im on better meds now, going to therapy, and just trying really hard to love myself. I am going across the country for the entirety of my summer vacation, and i plan to continue to work on myself in a superficial way ya know, just like losing weight, stuff that will make me more comfortable and confident in my body. So i guess hereÃ¢??s the question: would it be stupid of me to ask to reconnect with him when i come back from vacation. WeÃ¢??ve been broken up for awhile, and thereÃ¢??s still a lot of time for growth between now and when i plan on asking him. Idk, i just really miss him. WeÃ¢??ve both grown a lot and I want another chance...is that stupid?\n\nTLDR i guess; should i ask to reconnect with my ex?",

IÃ¢??m scared to make a mistake around them because if I do theyÃ¢??ll snap and start yelling at me. I remember the last time I made a huge mistake they told me to get out of their house and live on the streets... They said that IÃ¢??m nothing without their support... IÃ¢??m scared to talk to them, to ask them for anything... I feel like IÃ¢??m just being so selfish. ItÃ¢??s not like theyÃ¢??ve ever hit me or anything, and IÃ¢??m lucky to not be in that kind of situation, but I still donÃ¢??t know if I can handle being treated like a monster... I know, itÃ¢??s selfish and IÃ¢??m being ungrateful but I just wanted to let this out... \n\nThey always see me on my computer ( usually doing productive things like art, homework,etc. but they donÃ¢??t know that...) and begin yelling at me for it and saying IÃ¢??m a lazy, spoiled brat. theyÃ¢??re not wrong I suppose... but I still get hurt by their words... I know I shouldnÃ¢??t, and I should just stay quiet and be doing things like study and homework, but IÃ¢??ve already finished those things... so when I go onto my computer after finishing, they just yell at me and say IÃ¢??m addicted... they say IÃ¢??m gonna to get brain damage and IÃ¢??m gonna end up stupid.\n\nMy older sister... She gets along so well with them... They love her so much and IÃ¢??m so glad that they do! I really am! I love my sister as well, and sheÃ¢??s the most amazing person I know. I donÃ¢??t want to tell her how I feel about how they treat me, sheÃ¢??s already so stressed from high school and I canÃ¢??t push her to do more...  My parents always yell at me for small things like dropping small bits of food and such. And I completely understand this (I should never waste food) but sometimes I canÃ¢??t take their constant yelling... and I end up crying. I try to cover my tears, but when they see me cry they just get madder and say that IÃ¢??m so manipulative for trying to make others feel bad... theyÃ¢??re probably right, I donÃ¢??t even want to let them know how I feel, because if I do theyÃ¢??ll say IÃ¢??m being ungrateful and spoiled.\n\nEven if I did tel, them, it wouldnÃ¢??t matter to them I suppose... I once broke into tears and began crying when they said I was retarded and that IÃ¢??m horrible. ( I was fairly young at the time, about 9 I suppose ) At the time I was young and immature and I thought it was okay to cry... I locked myself into a closet and started crying loudly... when they came up, they told me to be quiet. I cracked a little, and began pouring out all my thoughts... I told them I was a disappointment, a failure, other depressing things I really donÃ¢??t want to talk about... What they told me next was something IÃ¢??ll never forget, \nÃ¢??Why are you like this? Only god can help you, you sick freak...Ã¢?Â\nI guess this was when I learned to not cry or show my feelings in front of them... I suppose they were right though... IÃ¢??m a freak... IÃ¢??m ungrateful, spoiled, and insane... I feel so bad... why did they have to end up with me? Why did they end up with a freak? I just... donÃ¢??t know how much more IÃ¢??ll be able to take... I feel like IÃ¢??m going to break someday... IÃ¢??m scared! IÃ¢??m scared of the day when I finally canÃ¢??t take it and break apart... \n\nI just needed some place to let it out I guess... If I made you feel sad or bad, I really sorry... please forgive me... DonÃ¢??t think about my story any longer!",

She decided it was best if we break things off yesterday, which didnÃ¢??t surprise me, but hurts nonetheless.  I told her that I would be here for her always.

As we got older (end of freshmen year \/ sophomore year) it came to the attention that we were both in love with each other. We tried to have a relationship in sophomore year but it never ended up working out. (We also go to different schools but live about 10 min away from each other) We still remained close friends and we got back together for one week during the beginning of our Junior year, but the thing is that she was talking to Senior at the time. She ended things with me that week because she wanted to Ã¢??live her teenage years fullyÃ¢?Â because she always told me that we would get married and have children together when weÃ¢??re older. They later ended up getting into a relationship that lasted 2 months before she ended things with him because Ã¢??she was in love with someone elseÃ¢?Â (indirectly talking about me). But when she told me that, we still never talked as much as we did when we were best friends. (We werenÃ¢??t Ã¢??best friendsÃ¢?Â because she had a boyfriend if that makes sense). I later found out from her friend about a month after she broke up with him that they were back together and she never told me. Even after talking so much shit about him when they broke up. And i really am in love with this girl and never felt about this way about any other girl iÃ¢??ve ever tried to have a relationship with and iÃ¢??m not sure what to do. Would it be wrong to ghost her for a little while or should i still text her every so often. She never made a effort to text me after she broke up with him after claiming that it was because she loved me they broke up, so i would only think she would want to talk to me. I feel extremely bad ghosting her but it seems to me that she doesnÃ¢??t really care too much. \n\nSorry if this made little to no sense to anyone reading this. This is just something iÃ¢??m currently dealing with and i have no one to talk to \/ get advice from about this situation.\n\nThanks btw if you read this, ur a real one.",

But this time, i was like : okay let me test something out. I didnÃ¢??t talk to any of my friends on social media (almost) i guess and i just wanted to see if theyÃ¢??re gonna send me a message or something and nope none of them did actually, i did sent a message like to 2 people and itÃ¢??s about some urgent stuff but i was ignored lol also IÃ¢??m in a small groupchat with my friends and when they were talking i just keep leaving messages on read so maybe they talk to me or ask me whatÃ¢??s wrong or why iÃ¢??m not answering & talking, but that didnÃ¢??t happen of course and i swear to god if it was another one than me then they will ask whatÃ¢??s wrong! \nSo in conclusion : if i donÃ¢??t try messaging my friends , itÃ¢??s either they literally forget about me or they donÃ¢??t even message me. And this weekend i spent almost the WHOLE weekend alone. the only people i spoke to are either my parents (not that much really like just the normal boring conversations) and some girl who iÃ¢??m doing a project with and thatÃ¢??s literally it. \nCan i have and advice here?What do i do so i can feel less lonely.?",

Sorry for formatting, on mobile.\nI am just barely on the spectrum.\nBackstory: IÃ¢??ve written about my mother before. SheÃ¢??s always so calm and fun, but the moment something small goes wrong sheÃ¢??s in a mood. I donÃ¢??t know if IÃ¢??m too close to see it or something, but some people have told me sheÃ¢??s gone way too far and not the best parent. \n\nIÃ¢??m now in a Brain Balance program, started two weeks ago to help me. I have focus and listening problems, and can never actually think about the choices I make. IÃ¢??ve gotten better, but this is a three month program thatÃ¢??s barely started. The gist of it is at home I have a set of exercises to do every day, and I do them even though it makes no sense to me. \n\nHereÃ¢??s what led up to this problem- last night, in one of my not-thought out responses, I decided I didnÃ¢??t want to do two out of seven chores. So I just didnÃ¢??t. And who tells their parent Ã¢??hey I donÃ¢??t wanna do this so IÃ¢??m just gonna walk awayÃ¢?Â no, everyone covers their tracks. Apparently because I didnÃ¢??t fold sheets and do the dishes, mother was tipped over the edge.\n\nShe woke me up roughly this morning, and yelled at me that IÃ¢??m doing everything right in front of her for now on, including moving my working station to right next to hers (she works from home and IÃ¢??m homeschooled now). I could never work well while others were watching me in school, and now she wants to glare at my computer screen all day and judge each step I take to complete my work.\n\nI canÃ¢??t post pictures on mobile as far as I can see, but these texts happened this morning.\n\nMe: I donÃ¢??t mean to be rude, but I earned the ability to work in my room and chose to save it. Why am I being forced to work right next to you, just because I decided I didnÃ¢??t want to do some chores? You know IÃ¢??m bad at making decisions and thinking things through, thatÃ¢??s why IÃ¢??m in a class. IÃ¢??m trying to fix things but 6 days of brain balance wonÃ¢??t fix everything.\n\nHer: We can discuss this in person.\n\nMe: IÃ¢??d rather do it over text, you know how bad I am at communicating my thoughts in person...\n\nHer: Improving your in-person communicating skills is part of the goal.\n\n\n\nI donÃ¢??t post often to reddit at all, but I really need help here. What should I do?\n\nEdit: we had a Ã¢??talkÃ¢?Â. She had her voice raised the whole time about how I had 5 Ã¢??Ã¢??Ã¢??Ã¢?? days to do work last week (ItÃ¢??s the same every week, why is last week special?) and how the chores just broke the camelÃ¢??s back. Every time I asked for one day to make things up or actually spoke up (being in the spectrum, I have a really hard time saying what I want to), she would full on yell at me. She ended with Ã¢??go cry into a pillow or whatever but this is how itÃ¢??s gonna work. ItÃ¢??s called tough love... nevermind, not going to go there, itÃ¢??s just offensive and will make you ugly cry more.Ã¢?Â\n\nIÃ¢??m actually considering going for a walk with my phone tracker off for an hour or two.

  "Post": "So, im a 15 y.o. male. I've always been a little \"down\"\/depressed (dunno), and I feel like i'm a little too careless about family, friends, etc, though i love to be with my friends. I don't know if this is a little over -estimated of me, but i think that despite being like that i may be a too much altruistic.\n\n So, some months ago, there was this girl in my class, and we've been friends for some time. One day, some dramatic things happnened and I fell in love with her. Like, i'm not even joking, it wasn't a crush, obsessive crush neither, i straight fell in love. I felt like i never loved anything like her in my whole life. Okay, some things happened, i discovered that in the end (at least with relationships matter) i am really careful and loving, and we ended up dating. So, everything was going fine, after some time she started acting a little strange, and after 2 months she broke up with me.\n\nI just broke down, i didn't know what to think or what to do. Did I do something wrong? She was the one with problems? and i'm a very, very sentimental person, so this was really hard for me to accept as she literally was my world. \n\nSome time passed since then, and now's the real problem: I fear that I might end up living alone the rest of my life. Some time ago I started to think a little, and this is a little hard for me to explain, but I feel like I will never find someone for me. It feels like i'm a little disappointed with people today. Everyone's feelings seem so superficial, like everybody just wants to \"fuck\"\/ have sexual experiences, I know a lot of people and I dont know anyone who isn't like that.\n\nI just want someone who really loves me as much as I loved her, but for some reason that seems impossible to find. Every person i see on the streets seem at the same time \"mean\" and \"superficial\" in that way I described. Maybe i'm just delusional and nobody is like that. I mean, I obviously want to have these kinds of things, i'm human too, but i feel like nobody have true feelings for other people. Maybe I am right, and people are not the way I expected them to be, and unfortunately, that seems even more true in the country I live, as people here are really \"sexualized\". Maybe people have true feelings but i'm just a boring person, despite my efforts to be someone fun and \"great\" to be with.\n\nI don't know why, but at the same time I feel like it will be really hard for me to fall for someone again as I look down on people that much. \n\nSummarizing, I feel like the kind of people I like (people just like me, really caring and care-needing) do not exist anymore, and I will never fall\/have interest for anyone for the rest of my life, and me being this really sentimental person I am, living the rest of my life like that is impossible. I know that i'm too young for this but it feels like, in the sense of relationships, I'm a really mature person, in the sense that I want a really serious relation.\n\nAlso, that girl showed me a part of life I never knew, she kind of remembered me how feeling happy is, because I haven't felt that kind of happiness that you can physically feel in years. In fact, I haven't felt any kind of happiness for a really long time, and know that she is gone, there is something missing.\n\nTL;DR : I basically think i will spend the rest of my life alone because I will never have any kind of interest in people as I think people today are not the kind of people i really like, which are really caring and loving people. As I am a really sentimental person that loves that feeling of real love, not any crush, it is impossible for me to live alone after my ex-gf, someone i loved more than the whole world left me, leaving some kind of \"void\". \n\nI hope to find someone that feels the same as me or either is someone like me in the sense of being both really care-needing and care-giving, so that I know I'm not correctly hopeless. I know that this issue may seem really kind of \"dumb\" for most people, but it is destroying me as I need someone in order to live happily. Thanks for reading",

Like, he knew we had something going on, and like I wouldn't be mad to keep him as a friend. \n\nI like him so much, that i would gladly accept friendship, I care about his happiness. And since we flirted, we opened up to each other and stuff, it did hurt a little when I got the news. Well, he now knows that I know about their relationship. \n\nWhen out of nowhere, he sent me something about being me really hot and stuff, complimenting me and I dont even know now. \n\nI'm in a weird position at the moment, I dont know how to feel or do. Like I said, I dont mind him as a friend, I just want to be in his life (not force myself into it obviously) but I just want his happiness. \n\nMaria (our friend) decided to invite me to go out with another guy friend and another girl friend, when out of the boom she is like \"oh, and John is comming\" when I already accepted the invitation. \n\nI really want to see my friends but my feelings are mixed about him. We will be going out on Sunday, so I've got this week. \n\nWhat should i do?",

We would fall asleep on FaceTime together talking about anything, sharing our insecurities,etc. I guess I ignored the signs he kind of liked my friend.. he kind of ghosted me for 4 days. So me and my best friend set him up! He was answering NONE of my calls, so an hour later she came over and called him, he answered within seconds. DidnÃ¢??t even answer my texts asking if everythingÃ¢??s alright, nope, left opened. She told him to call me because I was worried. His answer? Ã¢??Why.Ã¢?Â I broke down right there. I then broke up with him and had some excuses but i had enough. things went into an off and on relationship but, overall it was over. I did my retail therapy and got over it. Then, I see his name on the top of her snapchat a lot..not wierd right? How about when I tell you she shows me a strong majority of her snapchat messages without it even being my concern or business but if he texts sheÃ¢??s quick to not open it until IÃ¢??m out of sight..I donÃ¢??t want to seem controlling OR clingy. But, something just seems up...any ideas or tips? I could use it. Eh, back to retail therapy. Maybe I should let it be,I feel so annoying right now..",

I had met her in a wood shop class and we really hit it off. I am a very shy person so dating and being a couple wasnÃ¢??t my thing really. We got together and instantly everyone started looking at me different because I had gotten with her. Like I said, I was very shy and wasnÃ¢??t Ã¢??upÃ¢?Â on the drama around the school. She had apparently been the biggest slut in school and had dated and had slept with a lot of guys.\n\nBut I didnÃ¢??t see this at all, maybe because I was so in love for the first time in my life or that I didnÃ¢??t want to believe it but I donÃ¢??t know. Our relationship lasted about 4 months and in that time we had sex and she took my virginity. Eventually, the talks around school about me and what I was doing got to me. I was very insecure about going out with her and slowly I decided to break up with her. The way I did it was kind of shitty but I didnÃ¢??t know how to properly break up with a girl seeing as this was my first serious relationship. She had gotten me upset about something and instead of forgive and forget like I usually would have I made a big deal out of it and stayed mad at her for a few days, thought because she wasnÃ¢??t around me but I was still with her that people would look at me different but thatÃ¢??s not wha happened. Everyone still treated me the same until I cut her off and blocked on everything.\n\n2 years later, I havenÃ¢??t spoken to her and I am in a relationship. I still think back to our times together and how that relationship felt different than this one. Me and my ex were much more sexual and physically in love than my current. DonÃ¢??t get me wrong , me and my current girlfriend do get touchy, but itÃ¢??s not as often and not as passionate as with my ex. \n\nMy question is, is this bad to be feeling this way? My current girlfriend knows of my ex and has told me multiple times how much of a slut she was, but I canÃ¢??t help feeling that i saw a different side of her when it was just me and her either out and about doing things or having sex, it was something I couldnÃ¢??t describe. The things she did were true and there was evidence for what she did, but for some reason it didnÃ¢??t matter to me.\n\nTL:DR: broke up with my ex because of how I was looked at with her, and miss our physical love.\n\n\nEdit : me and my girlfriend broke up a few months ago and IÃ¢??ve been single since. Few girls here and there but no relationships. Just canÃ¢??t do it right now",

  "Post": "Backstory(kinda boring tbh):\n\nSo I met this guy while I was on a school trip and his mum(who is a teacher and is really sweet) brought him along. I developed a crush on him and we both had a crush on each other until I ghosted him for a month(at this point we had been talking for 4 months via text and hadnÃ¢??t met up since the school trip) then we both lost those feelings). We then talked for 9 months until we actually met up irl.\n\nSo now I had talked to him for over a year at this point. My friends then shipped us and on NYE my friend Milly pranked him by telling him that I liked him I liked him(she stole my phone), but then he said he liked me too. Turns out Millie was texting him privately telling him to say that and he didnÃ¢??t know it was a prank. But I went along with the prank pretending saying I liked him(lying). But then he still said he liked me, so I convinced myself that I liked him(which I now know I donÃ¢??t). I said I wanted to think about if I wanted to date him bc I knew he was kinda a player.\n\n\nACTUAL STORY:\n\nSo the teacherÃ¢??s son(who I had been texting for a year and had met up with 4 times) asked me to go to the movies AS FRIENDS so I said sure. We got food before and he put his arm around me a couple times but let go quickly, obviously nervous.\n\nWhen we got there he put his hand on my thigh and I acted as if I didnÃ¢??t notice. Once the movie started I put my hand near his and he grabbed it and held it. Then he put his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder, eventually he started lightly kissing(and I mean I couldnÃ¢??t even feel it I thought it was an accident) my neck, hair and shoulder. I was trying to lean away from him(so his head wasnÃ¢??t resting on my shoulder) but he had his arm around me so I couldnÃ¢??t.\n\nI went to the bathroom to freak out to my friends. When I came back I grabbed his hand and held it. He started rubbing my thigh, slowly inching up and kissing my shoulder leaning his head on my shoulder for a second and then sitting back up. His hand got really close to my crotch and I tensed up, he noticed and stopped about 2 inches away from my crotch(*). Then leaving the theatre I grabbed his hand and held it. He was fully aware I had never dated anyone before so I thought this was normal first date things. \n\nAfter I wanted to know what he was thinking so I texted him and he replied(his old Gf is called Chloe)\nÃ¢??Idk I basically acted like I acted when I was with Chloe and when I realised that in fact you are not Chloe and that you are different it was too late but by then you had reciprocated and then I just went with itÃ¢?Â\n\nSo I acted like he didnÃ¢??t just say that and went along with it, until I told him I didnÃ¢??t want to be a rebound, he said I wasnÃ¢??t but he knew why I would think that. I basically just went off on his and we argued for another hour. Then after all that we both kept saying Ã¢??we can just be friends if you wantÃ¢?Â and then I eventually said that and he replied Ã¢??ok gnÃ¢?Â and I said Ã¢??goodbye and sorryÃ¢?Â. I eventually apologised(**). \n\nAftermath:\nI cried a couple tears because I didnÃ¢??t want to stop dating him, but then I realised I didnÃ¢??t really like him, or maybe I do? IÃ¢??m not really sure tbh. He still likes me and thinks I like him. IÃ¢??m keeping up with this whole Ã¢??just being friendsÃ¢?? with him and itÃ¢??s going really well.\n\nWHAT I NEED ADVICE ON:\nSo now what? Do I tell him? Keep him thinking I like him just incase I change my mind? Do I like him? I NEED HELP\n\n\n\n\n* He actually ended up apologised for that after via text and I said it was fine but he said he was really sorry\n\n** I said Ã¢??Look, IÃ¢??m really sorry about yesterday. I wasnÃ¢??t really angry at you thinking I was Chloe or whatever I was more upset that I reciprocated and you didnÃ¢??t want that. One of my friends says that I tend to Ã¢??deflect my problems into other peopleÃ¢?? or Ã¢??blame myself for things that arenÃ¢??t my faultÃ¢?? so I think thatÃ¢??s what just happened. Sorry. Also IÃ¢??m off my pill and itÃ¢??s shark week so IÃ¢??m incredibly impulsive and all of my emotions are revved up, complete with mood swings.

(Im not going to call it a depressive episode because I was not diagnosed with depression or anything of the sort.) I didn't recieve any help throughout the time and just bottled up everything and covered it up with a goofy personality I created. I tried to discuss it with adults in my life but they shook it off saying I was going through a phase and that it will go away as time goes. Now Ive been realizing changes that I haven't noticed that began around july of this year. I've been unmotivated to do anything, All the love and passion I had for certain activities went away. It's hard for me to remember any joy or pleasure I had. Through the small period of August of 2018 till July of 2019 I had burst of high energy (like in small episode 1-2 weeks every other week). And at this point I'm just confused. \n\nI'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about this problem if I do I just have an underlying concern or worry that they'll contact CPS.

IÃ¢??m at a loss for words because my sex drive is crazy so my friends have been calling me a man whore for years already and this, this is gonna make that all too real. I feel so powerless knowing that I fucked up and thereÃ¢??s nothing I can do to fix it. The only thing now is I really do like that girl and if we can keep it going between us then things will be ok I guess. If you were in my situation what would you do?",

This is the place where i can let all my troubles because i trust people on the internet more then my own parents.\n\nIÃ¢??ll be talking as if i am confronting my parents.\n\n1) Mom and Dad, i know about your porn account and what you do. You have lied to me saying itÃ¢??s a service for online shopping. I know your login. I have screenshots of you and Dad sexting complete strangers on the internet. I have seen you take nudes and send them to people. You pay for this service, but i donÃ¢??t know how much. I have dozens of screenshots that iÃ¢??ve sent to myself of you chatting with these people. I want to tell someone about this, i do.\n\n2) I dislike it when you scream\/scold at me for simple reasons. You end up hitting me because of it, and meanwhile, iÃ¢??m left there crying. I try my best to relate to you, but no matter how, you wonÃ¢??t listen. I donÃ¢??t know what to do at this point, so i take it all in.\n\n3) That one time i was in the shower, i was crying because you were telling me i was ungrateful and that i was the reason why my pet bird died. You were drunk with your friends and kicked her and didnÃ¢??t help her. I donÃ¢??t like you for this. I remember calling you asking if she was okay, and you said yes.\n\n4) I was mentally and emotionally abused by my ex-girlfriend back in 8th grade. She used to tell me i was worthless, i wasnÃ¢??t trying, and that i was ugly. \n\n5) Because of that, i started to self harm. I cut my thighs a lot, and simply say that itÃ¢??s just bad stretch marks.\n\n6) I donÃ¢??t feel like i have any privacy. You go through my phone countless times, through my contacts and apps.\n\n7) You donÃ¢??t know i have discord.\n\n8) I am dating someone named Otto. (M) We met on discord and grew to like eachother, we know how we look like, we know how we sound like. We have made an agreement of boundaries to respect eachother and when we need personal space. He lived is Kansas, and i like in Texas.\n\n9) I donÃ¢??t know if i have depression or anxiety. I am friends with someone from Texas A&M, his name is Dylan. He is studying for a major in psychology and he has told me i probably have depression.\n\n10) When i was in 7th grade, i used to go to Dylan so tell all my problems to. He was there when you never gave me the physical and emotional attention. He was the one who gifted me the moon necklace for my birthday, not my friends. I called him a Ã¢??secondaryÃ¢?? parent. You donÃ¢??t know his girlfriend took her own life, and that his mother also died. \n\nI want to tell my parents about this, but i donÃ¢??t know how. Every time i try to tell them calmly and with kindness, they proceed to scold me for my actions, calling me useless and ungrateful. I have to take care of two cats, two dogs, and i do most of the stuff for you since you are busy fucking in the bedroom. I do your taxes. I keep count of your things, things you can do yourself. You are almost 50. I donÃ¢??t think grandma and grandpa would like this.",

IÃ¢??ve been talking to the girl who I have a crush on for almost a month straight like none stop and just having fun and playing around even during the school day. I was the only person she really let into her life fast and so deep. So one night me and her was on FaceTime talking and I told her I like her and she already knew bc of how obvious I was. She told me some things like Ã¢??I donÃ¢??t wanna date you because I just donÃ¢??t wanna be known as just one of your highschool girlfriends and I donÃ¢??t want a friendship that could last years to end in monthsÃ¢?Â I honestly completely understood that but she knows that IÃ¢??m not that type of guy and I would wanna keep a relationship for ever and soon maybe marry (aka even tho itÃ¢??s a young age IÃ¢??m dating someone to marry down the road)  and sorta backed away from showing any affection but then I sometime still do. Me and her still talking and fooling around but then I found out her mom wants me over for dinner, I never talked to her mom or anything so she must have been talking to her mom about me right? And then thereÃ¢??s the goofiness with the times me and her hang out. When we hang out we act like total crack heads and canÃ¢??t stop smiling and laughing and just how she would lay on my shoulder and just seem so comfortable there or when I lay on her shoulder she boops my nose. And then when she hugs me she squeeze me so tight and just hugs me for a little while when god those times feels amazing. Or how when IÃ¢??m able to get the crackhead out of her 24\/7 and one night me and her was texting and she says Ã¢??I love you, I actually love you....Ã¢?Â and like she donÃ¢??t think I saw that but I did. And then itÃ¢??s the times where she Lowkey sorta disregards everything else to talk to me it seems. But also thereÃ¢??s the one side where it tells me that she doesnÃ¢??t like me. When after a week of telling her I like her she was like Ã¢??ugh you still like me stop alreadyÃ¢?Â and she would say those sometimes. She can be known as a hard ass but she has her reasons. Just she makes me feel something else and I donÃ¢??t know if u should try to make some moves and ask her out or just keep it on the down low? What should I do?",

They told me a while back, after they first confessed they were attracted to me, that they didn't want to date me because they didn't want to mess it up. I was okay with not being in a relationship with them, but I share the same feelings with them. A month or so ago we were having a deep conversation and they said that the main reason why they didn't want to date me was because they knew we would never break up unless it was very serious. They didn't want to lose me, and jeopardize our relationship. I understand completely. \n\nSo even though we aren't dating, we say we love each other everyday, talk everyday, play video games together, and we even sit down and watch movies together for hours quite often. There is never a day that goes by without us showing our affection for each other. \n\nA problem that is going to come up, without a doubt in my mind, is sex. I know that they would never try to force sex on me. But they've already told me that they do want to have sex, and I mean, so do I.

I don't want to have intimate relations like that with someone that's not official, or boyfriend\/girlfriend, engaged, married, ect. I just don't know how to say that to them. And I don't want them to feel like they are expected to by my boyfriend\/girlfriend. But I don't feel comfortable doing it with someone who's relationship status is still a friend. And I also don't want them just to say yes because they want the sex.\n\nWhat can I do, or say to them? Am I stuck with just being best friends with them?

(LetÃ¢??s call her B). I asked her to get in contact with the girls mother and inform her about the situation, which she did.\n\nHer mother recently called me and asked about everything, and I told her the truth. She asked me why I mentioned it to B. I told her that her name was being thrown around in a discriminatory matter, and I assumed she wouldnÃ¢??t like that. She agreed and told me she would call the other girls and ask them about it.\n\nThis might be a little selfish, but the reason IÃ¢??m having trouble with this is because I know that the motherÃ¢??s daughter will hate me. SheÃ¢??ll talk shit about me, as she did to B who stopped being friends with her because B called her out on being a pathological liar. \n\nAgain, theyÃ¢??re the only people I sit with.

I've been into my friend for the last 2 years and I REALLY like her, but I don't want to tell her, cause I'm afraid of the worst (whatever that may be). We've been friends for about 3 years now, and have known each other for 4. Since I'm a Junior, I've pretty much gotten about 18(?) months to somehow tell her. She's like my best friend and she's extremely important to me. It feels like I've known her more than friends I've been with since 6th grade. I dont know what to do, because I just don't. She's NOT dating anyone right now, so I'm clear there. Today was her birthday, but I couldn't get her anything, so I'm planning to getting her stuff tomorrow before school. I'll make my decision of telling her or not based on you guys. Thanks!",

  "Post": "so I have been friends with this girl ( Y ) for quite some time . But lately our friendship has been going down the drain , It's just a buildup of some things that have been happening and have happened that I can't turn a blind eye to it anymore . Just recently it was her birthday and we wished her a happy bday but didn't buy her a cake . She did get a cake from her other friends in the next class so that night she called us out indirectly on IG saying how she would spend all of our bday and that she was naive to think that she even had a spot in our heart , she later proceeded to say she was stupid to think this friendship is real & she doesn't matter to us . She has a tendency to call people out on her social media when they're being \"unfair\" or not nice to her . From my viewpoint , I think just because we're friends doesn't mean  we're not obliged to buy her cake and she usually doesn't even split the bill when we have birthday cakes .\n\nAnother thing that really sets me off are her comments whenever I go hang out with other people than her. For example she would ask me where I'm going after school and I would reply \" oh I have plans with B \"  (my other friend) then she would say & I quote \" you bitch why do you hang out with B , you're always hanging out with ugly people . \" end quote .  Sometimes Y would say how I'm leaving her for B and how I don't care about Y anymore :( I just feel like Y expects me to be there for her 24\/7 and it equals to ignoring her if i decide to hang out with my other friends . Our whole class thinks dealing with Y is a hassle and some have even told me to ignore her but it's just that she is a nice to me and we do have some good memories together but now it's too much for me to handle and sometimes I just want my own space and I can't even get that without seeing another of her post on her social media of how her friends are leaving her  . Just this week she got admitted to the hospital and she pm me saying \" just wanted to tell you i won't come to school tomorrow but never mind you don't care anyways \"\n\nShe was also asking on her social media that if she died would we have anything to tell her . When me & my other friend ( O ) paired up for an activity , Y tells me she's disappointed in me that I chose to pair up with O . These are just some of things that i'm talking about as they're more recent and the ones that really put me off . I'm just tired of all this and sometimes I do like an a\\*\\*hole for choosing to hang out with my other friends . I literally have no idea what to do , I somehow feel like i'm stuck in the middle with her and my other friends with no exit .",

I sleep with my phone charged in by my bed and i lay it on my bed far away from me when im sleeping, yet my dad still comes in my room and lectures me about unplugging it because I'll get \"electrocuted\"...I get that he's concerned but ever since I had a phone Ive been doing this and nothing has happened, the charger doesn't even heat up! I try to tell him this and that I'm safe but he never takes me seriously or listens to me for any reason at all because \"Im younger\" so I just give up and I dont say anything. Would my phone actually electrocute me?? Isnt it just the same as me plugging in my nightlight?? (Which is also near my bed, it uses the same outlet as my phone, and its plugged in longer than my phone is) I wont make a big fuss over it cause that would be silly but I'm just very curious to know if thats actually hazardous, usually I wouldnt be asking this kind of stuff but he thinks everything is dangerous and that's not an exaggeration...I can't go outside or sleep over by family and Im almost 18.

  "Post": "Hi! I'm 17 years old and don't know what's happening with me. I want to be my old self again. \n\nWhen I was in elementary, I was a really good student (please, I'm not bragging). I was always at the top in our class. I get high scores and grades. When I graduated elementary, I was the one who has most medals. When I took an entrance exam for a science high school, I was in rank 27.5 out of 200. Yeah, I think I was doing great as a student.\n\nNot until I reach high school tho. That was the time I started to lose my grip in acads. I started to have lower grades (but still passing) and I struggle in acads especially exams and quizzes and recitations. Still, I managed to pass and have a with Honor Award until the end of junior high (Grade 10). \n\nAs I reached grade 11, Senior high, this is where I get worse. I can't focus and concentrate anymore. I struggle learning and listening in our class and discussions because my mind is always blank or always easily distracted. I daydream a lot. Whenever I review for our quizzes, I find it so difficult to review because the information I read doesn't retain in my head and i suck at memorizing now, unlike before, I was really good at memorizing. \n\nThere was a time, I reviewed and studied for our quiz but at the time and moment of answering the quiz, my mind was blank! All the information I studied and reviewed was totally gone! I do not remember anything at all! I failed the quiz and I only got a score of 16 out of 45. I only got 16 because I managed to copy my classmate's answers. \n\nI was very frustrated. I'm not being lazy or anything. I can't seem to focus anymore. I am so unmotivated and I don't know why. I want to be the \"good\" student again. \n\nNow, I have realizations and thinking about the past. When I was 11 years old, grade 5, that was the time I  started to struggle more often in acads. And that was the time too when my dad's illness became worse and he started to become more really weak and thin. That was the time too when I started doing self harm and suicidal thoughts (but not much). I thought they were normal and I have this thinking before of harming other people like torturing them or something but that kind of thinking was eventually gone when I reached grade 6 (but self harming and suicidal thoughts did not stop). I don't cut myself, but I do punch or hit myself with something like bottles or hammer. \n\nSince grade 5, I did not saw my dad smile again and I was really studying hard for him. When I was in grade 6, I thought that in our graduation, I'll see him smile. I told him that he'll be the one who will be on the stage with me so he'll put my medals on me. Unfortunately, 12 days before our graduation, he died, and I witnessed how he died. The day before his death, he called me and I saw him lying in his bed, very weak that he can't even open his eyes. I went near him and he was raising his hand, so I held it. He told me the words that hurt me so much, he said to me, \"I'm sorry, I cannot attend your graduation anymore.\" And that was his last words to me.\n\nGrade 7, 13 years old, the time where my suicidal thoughts became worse and the start of me being so unmotivated in school and struggling on focusing. At that time, I searched on the internet about my suicidal thinking and there appeared about mental illness and depression. But I don't want to self diagnose lol\n\nMy \"depression\" became worse when I was in Grade 8. Everyday, I always think how I'll kill myself. I also had this situation wherein Everytime I'll sleep, I'll dream! I have this condition since I was in grade 7. I thought it was cool since dreaming in sleep makes me feel like I'm in another world or something but then eventually I found it very annoying and tiring! I wake up very tired because of dreaming and I feel like it's making me insane! In about 1 and a half years, there was no single sleep where I'm not dreaming. \n\nThankfully, I managed to get rid of \"depression\" when I started writing in a diary\/journal when I started to have interest in stationeries.\n\nAnother thing about me is that I daydream too much and I have characters. I started doing this when I was 5 years old but I think that is normal. The thing is, up until now, I daydream like a kid and it's worse. Why? Because it distracts me so much and I cannot focus with the things I do because of it. There is so many triggers of my daydreams. \n\nAddition, I do not like being with my friends often because I wanted to be alone because if I'm alone, I can daydream more and I can have moments more with my characters. The urge is too much. \n\nI have a best friend character named Coco and I like being with him. I don't like him romantically. He is my best friend so yeah, it's fun being with him.\n\nI'm emotionally numb too, unless I am with my \"characters\" or daydreaming. There were times that my classmates were emotional but I was confused because why am I not feeling anything. Sometimes I fake to have emotions which results to me doing inappropriate emotions or expressions in some situations. \n\nAnother thing is that I often find it hard to sleep because I am daydreaming. Even though I am really sleepy, my brain keeps on daydreaming which makes me struggle to sleep. \n\nI know that all of this looks like now making any sense but I haven't shared this to anyone. I want to know what is with me. I want my old self back. I want to be the person again who can focus and concentrate in her studies and have good grades. I want to be the motivated student again. I want my old self. Please give me advice, please.",

Thing is she refuses the help I offer and going to the counselor,she says she is waiting for her doctor to open up a slot for her so she can get help. Tbh I am tired of her always complaining to me about how her life sucks and how she wants to die and how She wants help. Then the breaking point for me,Ellie has this guy she likes,letÃ¢??s call him....Ben,so Ben is kinda already knew but wasnÃ¢??t sure if Ellie actually liked him, I heard a conversation taht ben had with my classmates and they were trying it get him to spit out who he liked, I joined in and they said this girls name and he said Ã¢??no and itÃ¢??s not Ellie eitherÃ¢?Â,Ellie is one of these types who get sad and angry at the boy they like when they talk with other girls,she said to me once how she hated him for talking to other girls and not her I replied with Ã¢??well since he kinda already knows that you like him,itÃ¢??s probably awkward for him.Ã¢?Â She didnÃ¢??t listen. So she saw me talking with them and asked me what we Were talking about,I told her everything,she started crying and said she couldnÃ¢??t do anything anymore,I then suggested the counselor again,another no. After school we went to our dance club and after that,I quote her Ã¢??I just want to scream my lungs out and until my throat starts bleeding and kill myselfÃ¢?Â I said not to do that,and told her if the consequences of killing herself. I actually told her to confirm everything with ben awhile ago but she declined, and I told her before if she didnÃ¢??t do it this type of situation will happen,and told her to just either confess and clear things up or keep it in and either forget about him and try to move on or be in this situation. Now after I told her about the consequences of her dying,She again said she didnÃ¢??t care and thinks that we will be fine after a few months. I had enough at that point. Ellie is a sweet Girl and I want to be her friend but I canÃ¢??t take this anymore, she complains to me about dying and her depression but she declines my help and continues complaining to me,so I simply said Ã¢??well itÃ¢??s either you forget about him or do whatever the hell you are doing now,if you continue to whine to me all the time and keep refusing my help, you might as well suffer until some doctor comes and save you which isnÃ¢??t anytime soon,move on from him,heÃ¢??s just one guy you met in your 15 years of life,you have so many more chances in life later on. IÃ¢??m done.Ã¢?Â I feel really bad for saying that but I truly mean it,was I too harsh? Was I the one whoÃ¢??s wrong? IÃ¢??ve never lashed out like this before in fear of her killing her self and stuff,please give me advice.",

I barely interact with my family, even though they care about me very much. I'm an atheist, and I don't know how I will confront my parents about that , considering the last time my dad was confronted with something extraordinarily stressful (his parents getting in a car accident), he had a stroke. Also, I don't know about my sexuality. In real life, I only feel attracted to girls and look at them from time to time, but my sexuality is all over the place when I masturbate. I could want to give to a female, or take it from a dude, or give it to one. I have only masturbated to real life porn of girls, never guys. However, I have wanked to cartoon\/furry\/hentai guys, girls, yadda yadda. I have never looked or felt attracted to a guy, and I don't think I'm blocking anything. I could be though, and that worries me to no end. That could also be my OCD, same with my trans thoughts. I don't feel like I urgently need to become a woman or am one, but it comes up occasionally. Again, it could be my OCD, or I could be lying to myself. I don't know what to do with my life either. I think I want to do something in STEM and or music, but that could be another lie, and I really haven't explored my options. I have not had any will or desire to do anything. I had the occasional best friend, but it was only them, and it always ended in me realizing they were using me the whole time. I can't make any friends because they either have their own friend group and or are connected to the younger brother of that scumbag. I have never been directly bullied, but I can tell he is up to something.\n\nI'm sorry if this makes no sense or is too descript. I am craving for help, and my parents won't get help for me, since it never worked for them, and they don't want to \"disappoint\" me.",

As a young girl and young adult, my mother and father never let me have a boyfriend or even a guy friend in general, so I never have had experience speaking with guys long term, if that makes any sense. Plus, I believe since I was sexually assaulted it just made me stay clear from any man in my life, so I never had a strong friendship or love interest even though I wished I did. I am very uncomfortable and weary about speaking to any guys, and I get very easily scared but I want to break this cycle. \n\nI moved to college as a freshman a few weeks ago, so I am super far away from home (which was intentional) and I want to be able to venture out in the world of boys. Not even for boyfriends, I just really want some guy friends in my life. So, my first target to befriend is a guy who I only spoke to for a few minutes to ask a question which took me a lot of guts to be honest, since I am also very insecure. Yet he was really nice and seemed like a genuine person- so this leads to the question. \n\nHow do I talk to him now? We only have one class together and it's a college success class, and we don't share the same major even though he has the major I would love to pursue (can't though).

humor of a 14 year old on XBOX. heÃ¢??s a good guy, a helpful man. pretty selfless at times. \n\nhereÃ¢??s where our conflicts come in. as his daughter, i feel extremely emotionally disconnected. it took lots of dwelling and tearful nights to realize that thereÃ¢??s just a lot of disconnections going on. because my dad has been deployed so much, he didnÃ¢??t exactly get to see me grow. iÃ¢??m currently 16 almost 17 and he still treats me like iÃ¢??m a 9 yr-old. \n\nthe conflict truly began when he had to go to this one institute for a military school out of state. in order to keep me in the school that i was in, my parents decided that my dad would move while we stay. plus, the distance was only supposed to be for about a year. kinda important note, that discussion went without my knowledge considering i was 12 or so at the time. \n\na little on me, i was used to being with my mom all the time and she was and still is my primary guardian. my dad was always a provider but never took on the role of father authority. that wasnÃ¢??t ever established really. my dad took on the Ã¢??fun guyÃ¢?Â role. i wanted ice cream? we go and get ice cream. i want a new toy? as long as my grades were good (which they were) then i get a new toy. i was what most would call spoiled. which is true. i just never felt entitled to it because i also just never asked for much. just for my birthday and for christmas. never outside of that tbh. \n\nwell, a little thing called puberty eventually hit. and when that happened, it was like the new hormones in my body had this uncontrollable vendetta against my father arose. i will admit, the beginning of our conflict was my fault. but at the same time, i was only 12 and now learning how to deal with this new cycle of my life. i needed guidance but that guidance quickly turned into an accusatory finger. \n\nat all started with small things. to preface, my dad has always been the kind of person to swear, but i was the kind of kid to repeat what i would hear and to avoid getting in trouble, my dad put a bit of a filter on himself. well, with time that filter would diminish almost completely. but it started with that. too much swearing. and not even just casual swears, it was honestly very vulgar. too vulgar for a young teen (12-14). and even now, i donÃ¢??t mind curse words. i swear myself. iÃ¢??m basically desensitized at this point. but thatÃ¢??s not important, thatÃ¢??s just where it began. \n\nthen i started talking back to my dad when i didnÃ¢??t agree with something he said. and there were times were i was being a bit of an ass i will admit. it wasnÃ¢??t okay of me. yet even then, my dad didnÃ¢??t have the gut to put me in my place. when the back talking started getting much? my mom had to tell me Ã¢??your father said if you donÃ¢??t stop with the back mouthing heÃ¢??s gonna have to lay his foot downÃ¢?Â and i honestly just wanted to shrug it off, he couldnÃ¢??t even tell em that himself. any time in the future, he would sit me down, tell me how he felt, then nothing would happen. everything at a standstill. no progress. i didnÃ¢??t know how to take him seriously. \n\ni couldnÃ¢??t take my dad seriously at the time for a  handful of reason. despite his age, we still acts very immature in situations where that behavior is unnecessary. my mom tells him something he didnÃ¢??t like? heÃ¢??s rub his nose or forehead with his middle finger to basically flip her off. he gets confronted about something? turns himself into the victim and emphasizes the sacrifice he makes which has nothing to do with the confrontation. that or he lies. someone compliments him? often times he doesnÃ¢??t thank the person, just says Ã¢??i knowÃ¢?Â or something along those lines. i could go on but then it would be a manifesto. \n\nthe conflict between us has even gotten between my mom and i. im super close with my mom. but recently, i felt heavily misunderstood by her. i would talk to my mom about how i felt and she wouldnÃ¢??t give my grievances a second thought. sheÃ¢??d explain that i have to accept him because thatÃ¢??s the way he is. iÃ¢??m not asking my dad to be perfect. no one is. i just ask that he calms down and tones it down a bit. he canÃ¢??t explain anything without cursing up a storm and being loud as shit. when i was doing very poorly mentally, i cried to my mom twice about how i felt. with school, with myself, with my dad. everything. iÃ¢??m crying my eyes out to her and both times she told me that she didnÃ¢??t understand why i was crying, that i should be grateful i even have a dad, and to suck it up. i felt devastated and heartbroken after. i havenÃ¢??t opened up to my mom since (itÃ¢??s been about 7-8 months since that). \n\ni tried to fix my wrongs several times but each attempt was completely overlooked my both of my parents. the worst experience was when my dad was making empty threats about the people sitting behind us in the movie theater. my mom not being fluent in english, i had to explain some things about the movie which i did as quietly as possible. my dad apparently noticed that the people behind us made comments about it (but knowing that my dad thinks everyone is out to judge him and his family, he most likely took something innocent, personally). when we left he made a threat somewhere along the lines of Ã¢??if they would have said something to you guys, i would have knocked the shit out of themÃ¢?Â and said Ã¢??they arenÃ¢??t about it tho. no one was gonna say anything. they didnÃ¢??t the entire movieÃ¢?Â and he turns around, looks me dead in the eye and sternly says Ã¢??watch who youÃ¢??re talking toÃ¢?Â to which he has never done to me. heÃ¢??s never played his authority over me, ever. so i did what i normally do, just shut down. i became void of showing any emotion to anyone the rest of the day. a skill i got very good at throughout the years. later, we go to a hardware store and a car barely slowed down when we were crossing the street. my dad stared down the car menacingly and i rolled my eyes as he was turning around. he happened to catch me out of the corner of his eye and got in my face saying, Ã¢??you can decide to not talk to me for the rest of the day, rest of the weekend or even ever. but keep in mind that i just want to protect youÃ¢?Â i simple stared back at him blankly and continued to follow my parents around the store deadpanned. like his stare was gonna stop a huge truck from hitting my mom and i. i understood his point, the execution was just not very tactical. then, there was a little situation at the cash register and my dad verbally calls out a lady that left the cashier before the next person (who moved from a different line) could reach her register. im fairy certain she didnt see the man hence why she left. anyway, my dad say the thing and called out the rudeness of the situation without giving it a second of thought. he then shades me to the man, Ã¢??i had to speak my mind although some people,Ã¢?Â he looks at me, Ã¢??might not like itÃ¢?Â. i look at my mom in disbelief and then continue on my deadpan journey. i refused to hug my parents goodnight. i was mad at my dad and my mom was asleep. sheÃ¢??s a light sleeper so i wasnÃ¢??t gonna wake her up to say goodnight. i said goodnight from the doorway of their room and cried myself to sleep that night. \n\nmy mom told me after that i need to cut out the way iÃ¢??ve been acting. that i ask too much of my father and that iÃ¢??m the one that needs to change. iÃ¢??ve been beat down for simply standing up for what i believe in. i just want my dad to chill out but i can only get a reaction out of him when weÃ¢??re both upset. civil conversations always end up with no result. \n\ni tried to get to him in other ways but i always feel like i cant talk to him. he takes anything that isnt ass-kissing his ideas as defiance. we can never have civil discussion about any topic because i am a talkative person (incase it wasnt evident by this post) and i like to use lots of examples to make my point. my dad being such a straight to the point guy, rudely rushes me and gets impatient so he stops listening or interrupts me. but things where always like this. he used to listen to every word i would say when i was younger. but now, i canÃ¢??t talk for more than a few moments at a time before he feels the need to make comment or irrelevantly add some kinda related experience he had. heÃ¢??s so full of himself lately that i donÃ¢??t feel like i can get him to look eye to eye with me. itÃ¢??s like he cant fathom the fact that Ã¢??his little princessÃ¢?Â would have something bad to say about him. \n\ni could honestly go on forever and iÃ¢??ll end this mess of a post with this. iÃ¢??m leaving for college in less than two years. i want to fix things with my dad before then but i dont know how. he has this wall of insecurities and unresolved trauma growing up (along with trauma from being in the military) that he needs to resolve. he thinks he can win me over with petty little gifts but thatÃ¢??s not what i want or need. but he still continues to do it even after iÃ¢??ve asked him not to. what can i do? iÃ¢??m hopeless at this point and iÃ¢??m in a constant state of self doubt and self hatred because of it. i keep trying to better things while my dad gets progressively worse and idk what to do. \n\ntl;dr (i think thatÃ¢??s how itÃ¢??s used) my dad and i cant get along because we canÃ¢??t communicate and he often sheds the light as him being the victim. (not very accurate, please take the time to read. iÃ¢??m sorry).",

Due to some shitty circumstances my aunt(on father's side) and grandmother(mothers side) have joint custody of me. I used to live in Kentucky and went to a school where I got good grades, had good friends, and had relationships with the teachers (like a mentor\/mentee) but my aunt had decided that I should go live with my grandmother and said if I didnt like it I could come back. Ive been down here for 4 months and am 2 weeks into school going onto 3rd and she has said that i cant come back. I have a past with depression and so far it's come back to kick my ass. Ive tried to make the best of it by going to school and trying to do what was needed. Now no offense to any florida natives but your schools make suicide prevention seem like a fucking heaven, the kids at the school are assholes and havn't even tried to communicate with me and despite my best efforts to communicate with them I'm left feeling that they just dont give 2 shits about me, the teachers here have a huge tendency to distance themselves from students and make having a mentor\/mentee relationship feel like a kill yourself already relationship. I REALLY NEED ADVICE BECAUSE I AM DROWNING IN THIS SHIT and all my support is back in kentucky telling my aunt she is an idiot. Now before people say anything I want to point out, I dont do bad shit, neither of my parents can take care of me, there is a portion of the story that just can't be written down do to all the typing id have to do, and I dont need corny advice like just be yourself or give it time, ive had a shitty life and id like to keep the highschool part of it from being fucked into a gaping mess because I cant take the environment down here.",

I know its probably because I'm a teen going through puberty and stuff but I dont see ppl with this problem. My problem is that I dont want to leave my house. All my friends ask me all yhe time to hang out or go somewhere, but I make up excuses or say that i dont wanna go. I just feel really anxious and sad whenever i leave the house and I dont know why. My friends are all upset because i never want to hang with them. Idk why I feel likw this. And I also always want to see my mom. I follow her around all day because whenever i dont see her I get sad. I cried the other night because I felt like shit to my friends and because i was feeling this way. Idk wht im lile this but its been going on for a while. Im afraid that it will further affect my life and relationships with ppl. Help",

  "Post": "Hi I'm 16 years old and going to be a junior next year at my highschool. I ran track as a sophomore and now am doing cross country try over the summer but I have a big problem. My coach had a talk with me and my mom telling me he doesn't think I can continue on into the fall with the team running without being injured all the time and not being able to run. He said this and my mom agreed with him so now I basically got dropped from the team. The reason he said this is because I have screws in my foot from when I broke my ankle in the 8 th grade because I thought I had to play football and now my right ankle doesn't bend all the way forward which causes loads of imbalances in my running form that cause injuries. I basically suffered through the summer with running and was really stressed out but I worked my ass off and now being off the team I've just stopped. School has not started yet and theirs still a practice meet coming up which I could run in but I just feel so out of shape and my parents are set on me not running anymore. The coach told me I could join back on the team and run but it would have to be okay with my mom. I really wanna finish what I started in training and not loose my fitness but I've just been so unmotivated and seditary not running this week that I don't know if I can even have the ability to run. Everyday that goes by I can't stop thinking about how I should be running and the whole team is running without me. I hated practice when I was running and my ankle just made evei more stressfull but I LOVED everything that came with the running. The feeling of accomplishment after running 10 miles to taking an ice bath after to being able to eat big meals and feeling accomplished knowing how much work I just put in is like an addiction and I cant drop it. But now it's like what's the point of even running 4 miles if I'm not in cross country... I could still join back or just become a regular person and not be an athlete but I hate the idea of that. Also even if I did join back I know that I'm basically at square one right now and I would have to go through all this shit again in putting my all into train just so I can get to a reasonable level of fitness which pisses me off. Schools about to stark and I'm lost. Running did ruin my summer but I'm just to involved and invested in running to just stop.... Forever. I don't know what to do. I thought it would be fun to not have to worry about waking up early everyday and run, but now that's its actually a reality all I can think about is how i should be running. Just any advice would help.",

  "Post": "so i created this throwaway to ask this quesiton.  I dont really have anyone to talk to abt this so im kinda desperate.  Im entering highschool and ive been dating this girl for around two and a half months.  Ive known her since i was in kindergarten.  Becuase we go to private schools we can choose what school we go to.  I am going to a school that is around 45 minutes away from my house.  My older brother also goes there so he will be able to drive me there every day.  My girlfriend is going to a school that is around 10-20 minutes away from my school.  Because she has a rich grandmother she will have an apartment out there.  She will be at the apartment Monday-Friday and will be back at here house that is 15 minutes away from mine on the weekends.  There are really two questions im going to be asking. We are really clingy and can barely be away from each other for a few days without missing each other a lot.  I am wondering what i should do.  I dont want to breakup with her because i am not very attractive, on a good day a 6, but she is sooo beautiful and amazing.  I really wouldnt be able to do better than her, which makes only seeing her once a week even harder.  I just don't know what to do.  The second question i have is about her and her friend.  I live in Pennsylvania, about a 15 minute drive to new jersey.  But my girlfriends best friend is going to be moving to new york city for school in a week.  Because my girlfriend and her are best friends, they're both taking it pretty hard.  I really hate it when my girlfriend is sad and lately with her best friends move to new york city its been happening more and more often.  I want to know if there is a way that i can make her feel better about this move.  I would really appreciate any help.",

ItÃ¢??s to the point where I just feel sad all the time. My parents work everyday (seriously, they have no day off) until 8 pm. DonÃ¢??t get me wrong, I know they work hard to provide for me. But because theyÃ¢??re gone all day, IÃ¢??m left home all alone. ThereÃ¢??s often nothing to eat at home and because IÃ¢??m the only one home, IÃ¢??m expected to take care of all the housework.

My parents are overly strict and protective (ironic, I know). IÃ¢??m not allowed to leave the house at all. Sometimes I want to hang out with friends, like a normal teen for GodÃ¢??s sake.

We are both mature people so our relationship isnÃ¢??t just a fling and we both treat it seriously, which is really great. My parents know heÃ¢??s nice and they like him and they know how respectful he is. And his parents adore me. They invited me to his family only birthday party and they even invited me to their family summer vacation. They love me and theyÃ¢??re great people! The problem is that I feel like my parents donÃ¢??t trust me or him. IÃ¢??m never allowed to go to his house if someone isnÃ¢??t home and god forbid I go in his room with him with the door closed.

I, as the understanding friend, relieved a deep sigh and simply accepted my defeat. I was definitely disappointed but no hatred ever came out. I simply said, Ã¢??oh,ok. Hf then.

Today I tried to bring it up to them as a group. R dismissed my feelings quickly. This is another thing they like doing a lot. I'm very sensitive and any time I cry or get upset they yell at me and berate me for being sad. My mother has threatened to hit me before just for crying when she yells at me.

The reason that IÃ¢??ve decided to join this site is because I have some issues that I donÃ¢??t want to bother friends or family with because I donÃ¢??t want them to worry. Recently IÃ¢??ve been having some issues socially and quite frankly IÃ¢??m lonely. IÃ¢??m usually generally a happy person but being on my own brings me down very low and right now I do feel as though IÃ¢??m completely on my own and detached from the rest of the world. From a young age I have had problems with fitting in and making friends. These problems have came and went over the years but I always felt as though as I got older these issues would fade and I would find myself some how. I have now reached the age of 19 and I still have very little confidence and I feel as though I am missing out on things that other people my age are enjoying. I constantly beat myself up for not putting myself out there and making friends but I simply donÃ¢??t know how to. I always have this anxiety around people not liking me and preferring it if I wasnÃ¢??t there. I feel as though my lack of confidence puts people off being around me and makes them feel uncomfortable but this thought once again just makes me even less confident. ItÃ¢??s starting to really piss me off tbh just taking about it now. I just wanna get on with my life and enjoy it how I should be but I just donÃ¢??t know how to.

  "Post": "Hello people, it's my first post on Reddit, I'm not very used to the platform so, forgive me if I don't know how to use it very well.\nI need advice, I'm desperate because I had never had such a situation before... And I sincerely would appreciate someone who could tell me what to do in this scenario. It may sound childish, but it's a deep wound for me.\nBackstory: on October last year I started going out with this girl (who was a friend of mine, and my reduced circle of friends) and I had a great time. Things were fun for me, and I got to spend lots of good memories with her. I was happy enough, but noticed some discomfort in her behavior when trying to be a couple with her. She always excused herself in the \"I don't know how to express my emotions\" scheme, and I bought it. I must admit that at this time I had some depression and was toxic to her at times, but tried always to correct myself from that. And also, she dumped her problems with me, to which I tried my best to help her, as I thought that is what a good couple does. Time passed and she became more cold with me, until she broke up with me on December. I was really disheartened because of my low self esteem, thinking that it was my fault for not being enough for her. Yet, we remained as friends.\nLater, in a friendly talk (I remained interested in her, despite knowing she might not) she explicitly told me that the reason she broke up with me was because she was interested in another guy (I don't know who, maybe one of her old friends) and that she was really confused at the time, so she decided to break up to clarify her mind. I reacted surprised and upset at this, but decided to still give a shot to the girl as I profoundly wanted to be with her.\nThis lead to us coming back on February, now with a more mature me knowing more about her attitude and what I didn't like. The first days came good, but as soon as we reached the first week she went back to her old shitty attitude. I still liked her but craved for attention and affection. One day she told me in one of the \"she dumps her shit on me\" talks we had, that she had manipulated one of her close friends deliberately, and kind of non regretful. This was kind of a red flag, but I couldn't or didn't pay attention at the time.\nLater on I got fed up with our relationship, but decided I could still give it a shot if we were willing to change. So, I told her about what was I uncomfortable with, and what I needed, and so did she. Not even one day passed before she texted me asking to explain myself, because appearently my talk wasn't clear enough for her, even though I tried to make it the clearest possible. Just two days after that she came back with a response saying that \"she understands, but doesn't know what to do\" thing. I just said that it would be fine as long as she did something. Which happened. For a day. Just one day.\nAnd, at this point my heart was stabbed. It had happened not just once, nor twice, but THREE TIMES. I ended our lovers relationship, but said that we should continue friendship (as I have a limited group of friends, losing one is devastating).\nThis last part happened over a month ago.\nOh, I forgot to mention that we also had talks where she would start talking toxically, and this time I was more severe and just told her what I considered the truth, but in a harsh way.\nThe story: during this month I have found out a lot of things about the relationship, about myself and I grew to like another girl (one of our mutual friends). I thought of my ex mature enough to understand that we would just be friends. So I told her that I started liking someone (I didn't tell her who, not to hurt her... This recoiled later). And... After some days, she texted me telling me that she wanted not to be friends with me anymore. She didn't state why, but I accepted it. I asked if it was because I told her I liked someone else, and she immediately went berserk on me. She jumped on my throat, telling me all my flaws, calling me a motherfucker for having played with her feelings, and treating her badly. To which I exploded and told her all I felt. All the resentment I had, I spoiled it all over her face. She told me that she still liked me, and I couldn't buy it at all... And then... She gave me a very hard blow. She stated that this was the end of all forms of relationship with me, and said that it will be my fault what will happen to our friends... And, as they're the only ones I have... I fear that I might be left alone again. And I'm scared of that, and I feel guilty for it... Can someone tell me what to do in this scenario? I can't bear with it",

She was flying back to her hometown & was transitting through the city I lived in. She told me to meet up with her again on her way back to uni as she will be staying overnight at a hotel in the city I live in before flying international the next day. That was on a Friday night when I went to spend the night with her at her hotel room. I brought wine & pizza & was hoping for a girls night. But she invited her other f-buddy to come over for sex & she asked to me wait outside while she did him. I sat by the pool for over 1hr & was annoyed but still waited. Later that night she told me she got tickets to a club to watch a show & said she had a good guy friend (I'll just call him Jake) coming to pick us up. I agreed to go coz I never party, I'm not that kinda girl but I justed wanted to have some fun & live a little so I agreed. Fast forward I got super drunk & my friend said she'd look out for me. She couldn't be really drunk coz she had a flight the next day. Anyways I ended up going back to the hotel room with a friend of Jake that I briefly met. I don't remember how he brought me back to my friend's hotel room coz I was out. But I do remember waking up unconsciously & realizing he had me on the bed with my legs up & I realized he took down my trousers half way so I was half naked. I didn't see my friend, I think she let Jake's friend take me back coz I must've passed out. I felt pain in my lower abdomen, I think Jake tried to have sex with me & I drunkenly blurted out it hurts. Next thing I remember him telling me to pull up my pants & roll over the bed to sleep. I don't know of that was sex coz I am a virgin. Next morning I woke up hungover & saw that my friend had returned with Jake & Jake's friend was asleep on the floor. I had to sober up so I fumbled around the room looking for water then passed out on the floor. Jake's friend moved over to where I was laying & fingered me & I made a noise so he removed his hands from my pants. My friend & Jake were on the bed.\n\nAfter I left my friend I was so confused. I don't know if I wanted that. I felt violated & I have no one to talk to coz I am deeply embarrassed. I don't know if that was sec coz I've never had sex. And how am I supposed to know if he came in me. In my country, having pre-matiral sex is heavily frowned upon & is a taboo. Please I need advise it has been a week & I feel like I could just die coz the guilt & shame is so unbearable.",

WeÃ¢??ve been talking since, but one thing to note is she has a boyfriend. This dude barely gives her any attention, (even though it may be unintentional), barely hangs out with her, and hasnÃ¢??t been there for her muchÃ¢?? on the other hand, here IÃ¢??ve been, trying to show how much I care, respect her, and support her. She says she Ã¢??needsÃ¢?Â to be with him. She said it herself though, we talk more than she does with him.\n    So last night was this play-thing I went to to support her, because she never said anything about her boyfriend being thereÃ¢?? (we had already talked about this happening weeks im advance), and so as IÃ¢??m chilling at the table waiting for it to start, her boyfriend walks in and sits right near me. Keep in mind, he barely knows I exist. \n    As you can tell things werenÃ¢??t about to go smoothly, because she knew I liked her & that she had slight feelings for me as well. After the play, she comes off the stage and hugs her boyfriend right in front of me, since I was literally right there. Something hit me at that moment and I realized I liked her more than I thought because I pretty much bawled my eyes out afterwards. So I had to walk out of the school without even getting to congratulate her. I didnÃ¢??t because I didnÃ¢??t want to make anything suspicious \/ out of respect for him & her.\n   The same night at around 8:00pm, she texts and asked if I was alright. I was blunt and told her no, and she responded with a ton of empathetic & meaningful IÃ¢??m so sorrysÃ¢?? she didnÃ¢??t know he would be there. But I had to tell her how I felt, so I said it. Ã¢??Maybe we should pump the breaks. IÃ¢??m really into you, and IÃ¢??d rather not be the one lurking behind you & him for months at a time as yÃ¢??all keep getting closer, and then get too attached. I honestly care for you a lot, and I want to be with you. Just let me know how you feel.Ã¢?Â Ã¢?? she responds with something along the lines of Ã¢??I want to be him but I also want to be with you, idk itÃ¢??s just really confusing.Ã¢?Â I told her to give it time, but honestly I donÃ¢??t know if I can wait much longer knowing theyÃ¢??re in a relationship right now.\n\n   I need some advice right now.

But when he is genuinely seriously he can have a pretty serious conversation, and he is so smart on so many things. And I want to talk to him, I want to ask him so many questions but I get such a block. And I feel like it's because of his mental illness, no its not that I'm unable to look past it or something before someone says it lol. I love and care about every piece of him, but no feel like no topic is good enough to catch his attention or will not make him freak. I just don't know what to do, what to ask, how to learn about him!\n\nI sincerely just want to ask him things that he won't find stupid and small, I want a serious conversation something that can drive us closer or something. I'm trying to see if I can somehow get him alone in person? Maybe he's just a bad texter idk but I'm just super anxious. Ãƒ?ny opinions?\n(Thank you for reading lmao)",

This new crush is not the best looking, not always well known, and not an ideal bf or crush type. All of my friends just Ã¢??ship him with meÃ¢?Â but then also they are only excited since IÃ¢??m knows to be dull and not very emotional. I know for certain heÃ¢??s a nice person, heÃ¢??s super funny, sweet, and just great overall.  I have most of the day with him and thatÃ¢??s also a big factor. IÃ¢??m probably really obvious. So back to my friends, on the other hand they donÃ¢??t really know him. You know how girls and guys have different friend groups (IÃ¢??m not very popular). He also has this Ã¢??girlÃ¢?Â friend that he can talk with for fun. IÃ¢??m super jealous not gonna lie. One friend of mine asks Ã¢??what do you see in him?Ã¢?Â Another says Ã¢??itÃ¢??s cute and all but are you sure itÃ¢??s him?Ã¢?Â. And lots of them judge me for liking this guy, they say stupid things like Ã¢??he is crazyÃ¢?Â(tbh everyone is crazy) and some even say Ã¢??His nose is weird or something.Ã¢?Â Excuse me what? His nose changes everything? What I would like to say is, Ã¢??Your not that good yourself. You have lots of pimples and a bit of acne. ItÃ¢??s obvious you wear makeup. Your personality isnÃ¢??t the best, sometimes your like those bratty popular girls. You try to show off but also nobody notices, You make fun of me everyday.Ã¢?Â I know what some might think, this is VERY long and sheÃ¢??s a fake friend. Well I just keeps some people for company or support. Well anyways I just want to know what some people think in this situation or have any advice? Should I stop liking him, am I really in love? Should I stand up to them? What should I do, I really donÃ¢??t like when heÃ¢??s made fun of. Especially by my friends.",

  "Post": "Ok, so I used to go out with someone I would call D.H  for the sake for privacy (not that it matters).  We \"loved\" each other.  And I quote that because I really loved him but the things that he do never showed it. There was so many other things that was a red flag to leave him but I never listened. For example, this is the worse he's done to me,  it might not sound like much but it really hit close to home.  When I would be hanging with my friends after school, he would never tag along even after we ALL begged and begged he LITERALLY said he'd rather play games Ã°???. So I left him. It was sad but it had to he done.  What's the point of being together if he won't even take time out of his day to talk to me? After that,  I found someone new. I'll call him F. D. When we started dating, the very next day D.H went up to me and told me not to date F.D and to be with him instead.  I WAS SHOOK. And at that time,  I still had feelings for D. H because the reason we broke up in the first place was because he didn't act like we really loved me when I knew for a fact that I did.  So,  I broke up with F.D and went with D.H to give him another chance. He was a better person but I started to hang out with F.D again and.... cheated.  I didn't mean to but since I'm still a virgin,  all we did was makeout. So now I'm in this situation where I like both of them.  After a while,  D.H started acting the same as last time (acting like he didn't like me) and I started to hear rumors that he was gay.  It's probably not true but people are still talking about it to this day.  Personally,  I think he's bisexual because of \"things I saw him do\"with other guys Ã°?Â¤Â£and plus he dated a lot of girls.  When my friend said something about his ex, he got really mad and it bothered me that he still cares about her. I can't tell who broke up with who this time because I was talking to my friend and I told her to ask him if we should brake up because I'm a pussyÃ°?Â¤Â£.  He said yea so it was official.  We were broken up now.  Fast forward 1 year later I'm talking to him again but as friends and it's gonna stay that way.  You know that one ex you will never loose feelings for?  Yea he's one of mine.  And I can tell he still likes me too.  I sometime catch him staring at me but I ignore and try not to make eye contact and he smile A LOT when he's around me( I know it sounds creepy Ã°?Â¤Â£) . Now, F.D is back in my life and he's asking to get back with me but my friends think I'm over him but to tell the truth,  I'm not over him either.  I'm a WHOLE mess Ã°?Â¤Â£Ã°?Â¤Â£Ã°?Â¤Â£Ã°??Â¢.  So they keep telling him to stop asking me out but I'm sitting there next to them hella happy and wishing I had the guts to tell my friends that I do like him and want to go back out with him.  My situation is so bad.  Any advise?  Ã°?Â¤?Ã°?Â¤?(Sorry it was so long) ",

He proceeded to say it's pretty high, again I asked him what it was and he says 20... Um excuse me Ã°???. I was so taken back of course. Coming from a VIRGIN yes a virgin this really shocked me, I didn't know what to say or feel to be honest. I knew he was experienced but not that much !! Shit I thought it was like 5-8 maybe even 10 but not that high. We talked this over and told each other how we felt and everything is well and dealt with between us now but here's the thing... I don't know how to feel? On I've hand I feel like another number on a sex list when giving away my first time. (Additional info- I've never dated, had my first kiss, nothing I mean literally nothing man.) So giving him my v card away is a huge deal for me. \nOn the other I don't really care because it's his sex life and he's allowed to do whatever he pleases.  I'm emotionally constipated and I don't know how to make it come out Ã°???. My question, what would you do in my shoes?  A virgin willing to give away to him until she finds out his body count?

Before it was because my mom thought he was flirting with other people and for a time, he left the house at night and didnÃ¢??t come home till one or two in the morning. He also drinks every night. I donÃ¢??t think heÃ¢??s an alcoholic or anything but he drinks a little beer or wine every single day. Then my dad got sick. Life threateningly sick. And through that my mom stayed by him. During his recovery, they were on good terms and I thought things were getting better. But then my brother, who is in middle school right now, started being so rude. Every day my parents would be so stressed out because of him. He was talking back and wasnÃ¢??t helping around the house. He was so incredibly rude. They told me hey were getting divorced three times already over the past four years. And now my brother is stressing them out. Recently, my brother was being really messy and my parents were yelling at him to clean up. But he didnÃ¢??t. After thirty minutes he still didnÃ¢??t. ThatÃ¢??s when my dad got mad. But my mom is always on my brothers side. She said thatÃ¢??s heÃ¢??s going through a stage. But my dad didnÃ¢??t agree. So he left. He went to my relativeÃ¢??s house. And he said heÃ¢??s not coming back to our house unless my mom goes. ItÃ¢??s either him or her. I think this time theyÃ¢??re actually getting divorced. And I really donÃ¢??t want that to happen. IÃ¢??m in high school so IÃ¢??m going to be applying to college soon. I know financially we are going to be strained. And I donÃ¢??t want to move between houses.

I FEEL SO TRAPPED in the house as if the walls are caving in on me everyday. Im loosing my mind. I am going to college soon hours away from home .

At the beginning of the last school year, my junior year, I asked a friend, who I've known since kindergarten and the couple years before started to have feelings for, out to a concert, not on a date, but with a group. First of all, she texted me later and said no. It kinda hurt, but that wasn't really the problem. All school year she was friendly once and awhile, but usually tried to ignore me. I even asked her if I had done something wrong, and she couldn't even look at me as she no and ran off. Long story short, we're not as close and I got over it. \n\nNow, a year later, there's one other girl who just graduated that I know and really like. We've talked a few times, we go to the same church\/youth group, like the same stuff\/hobbies, but while everyone I've talked to said the first time want my fault, I'm afraid of I try to talk to her or anything I'll ruin it as soon as she figures it out. \n\nIt sucks cause I'm not known for being outgoing in my small high school and people seem to act like it's weird when I'm anything but shy. How do I get to know her better and eventually let her know how I feel without coming off as weird?",

I have two brothers one older and one younger as well as half siblings (they dont live with us). My parents are still together.\n\nMy dad isnt entirely bad. he works full time to provide me with as much stuff as possible and take us on holidays and helps us learn about our asian cultures as well as other cultures. He shows that he tries and everything.\n\nIt kinda started around the start of secondary school when I realised how I felt. My dad has always been extremely controlling, he doesnt like to take anything from anyone, and hes always been strict. \n\nIt first started off with little things, like for example, i was never allowed skirts, make up, a phone (i did for a while but not now), a boyfriend all the usual things. he used to jokingly make jokes about the not having a boyfriend when i was younger.\n\nThe thing is as i grew older I started seeking a little bit more independance, like wanting to go out with my friends without having to constantly check in like every 30 mins or being able to be trustworthy of things. By the time, I realised that my dad was already used to me being controlled in a sense? i never used to talk back to him or go against him or anything.\n\nOne example of him being controlling was my first boyfriend. i mean i realise he was stupid now, and i appreciate the concern and stuff, but the intent he had i was bothers me. a few months ago i was in a relationship with him and i intended to tell my parents. Back then i thought he was a genuinely nice guy and my parents could probably like him.\n\nwhen my dad found out he immediately made me break up with him over text and smashed my phone. he blocked him on every social media and stopped me from attending the youth group that we met in. he threatened that if i didnt, he would go over there and smash his face in. it had turned out that my dad had spoken shit about me to his parents so that they would enforce this too.\n\nobviously i was terrified and in tears, so i did as he said and i missed out about 4 months if this group and it absolutely killed me. i loved this group and the friends i made in it and all. i was so angry, but he kept explaining that its for the best, its his job to be protective and that we're in an asian house then whatever he says goes.\n\nthat was the first time that i ever said i hated him. not because of the boyfriend but because of how he handled everything.\n\nanother time was when my brother refused to go to university cause he wanted to pursue a piloting career. he made mistakes along the way but my dad was always there to shove his morale underground. he would always say shit like how he is going the wrong way and that he will never make it and things like that.\n\nive never accepted anyone making my brothers upset so i snapped.\n\ni shouted how its not fair for him to be like that and he took it out on my and immediately cut off everything like internet and youth groups because i said something against his opinion\n\nit came to the point where i packed my bags and threated (i was going to go through with it) and run away to stay at a nearby friend's house. he threated to call the police and put me into shit so i didnt go.\n\nwhen it comes to arguements, he refuses to let anyone else talk. it always has to be 'his opinion is law'. ive never had freedom and its so hard to be the only kid who's never had outings with their friends, or the person whos limited on what they can wear, who they can be with and what they see.\n\nits made me someone who is genuinely scared to let out my feelings and its so fucking shit. what do i do? am i supposed to feel this way? am i doing something wrong?",

  "Post": "When I was younger, I used to be very outgoing, but not very liked. I never had a lot of friends that I considered close. I went to elementary and middle school with very small group of kids (like 30 in the entire grade) and everyone knew each other very well. I never really established myself socially until middle school, and even then, I feel like most people just talked to me because they tolerated me compared to how annoying I was as a kid. A lot of those people were sereously toxic to me, and by last year (grade 9), I lost everyone that I could actually trust and tell my problems to, and I was around a lot of fake people that took advantage of me, and I kept everything in and I just grew angry at everything. I made a lot of mistakes and got taken advantage of really hard over a few years by a girl I thought I loved. Over the summer, I gained a lot of anger issues at home, and I got a really shitty outlook towards life. When high school began, I went to a high school that most of my other classmates didn't go to. For a while things got better, and I thought that my life would be diffirent. But over time I realized that I'm too reserved (socializing mentally drains me a lot, and I'm a very cringey \/ nerdy person when I'm really being myself) and I feel like none of the new people in my life are really my friends. I feel like when shit goes downhill, these people would leave me out to dry. All of my old classmates that I hear about are always doing better than me (popular, in a relationship, lots of friends, parties, genuinely happy, active social life) and it makes me feel really shitty. I promised myself that I would be way better off, and I am, but compared to everyone that I've been around most of my life, I seem like a complete loser. I blend in socially, and I have groups of friends that I can talk with and stuff, but I'm very smart (as in I get good grades with little effort), and that makes me stand out and come off as nerdy. I'm also p ugly and socially awkward, and it seems like everyone always likes me for my humor and awkwardness but doesn't appreciate me past that for who I am as a person, or the way I am. I defenitely have a social life outside of school, but it feels forced. I'm always the one making plans with others, and it's mostly the same people because In afraid to try to be better friends with others because I'm worried they'll bail on my plans, become fake friends, or worse like people in middle school would do to me. There's so many new attractive girls, and I feel like I'm too ugly and irrelevant to have a chance with any of them. I constantly feel under pressure to be succeeding more than these people that I used to know, or I'll be the same person I used to be. I feel like everyone else is out there having the time of their lives, and I'm just apart from them, being at home or being anti social. I'm not completely shy, and can be very confident and outgoing at times, but In not taken seriously in the way I want to be. I defenitely talk to people, and can tell that some genuinely like me, but I feel like it's the fake type like that people do to the advantage of you. I can't let go of the natural hate of people that I developed over the years, and I think it's really holding me back, along with stuff like social anxiety from being a better person.\n\nI know this post had been a complete rollercoaster, and maybe it was mostly so I could rant everything out, because I don't trust anyone else enough to tell them what I just wrote. Whatever the case might be, I feel like I've been going through some tough times recently, and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice?",

  "Post": "So I like this guy.(I'm a girl). We've spent our lunches hanging out together last semester. He helps me study for tests, and I help him study a little as well.But this semester, we have different lunches. He's two years older than me, and I'm not sure if he's treating me like a little sister or a close friend that he wants to get 'closer' with. Also, we've got this inside joke going: He wanted to adopt me as a pet. I am his pet now, and he always makes these jokes about 'I'm not feeding you O:<' and 'go make me a sandwhich' I'm a freshman btw, and I'm not sure which way this is going. My friends all think that he's acting a little kinky, that whole pet thing, and they think he likes me. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm FRIENDZONED (idk how that feels)or just a close friend. Any advice?",

  "Post": "let me start by making things clear - I've done wrong here. I won't shift the blame, I won't sugar coat it, and I won't start pretending its ok. I messed up. I've apologized and I apologize again.  I've had issues mentally (anxiety) for a while now, but this particular issue started nearly a week ago.  I was feeling particularly bad leading up to this, so I decided to visit a friend (person one) who is quite good to be around (to make this better, this person knows I've had a crush on them before but we were over that). through the day we hung out, talked, I taught them some self-defense and we had fun, and that was it. the week went on fine, and then 5 days later was my birthday party. myself, person one and a few others (including person two).  we had an attempt at a game, which dissolved into drunk comedy and fun, though I noticed at one point person two was a lot cuddlier that night. I didn't think much of it, however, as most people who were there are very physical like that platonically and I knew person two definitely didn't\/doesn't have feelings for me, which is fine. the following dad, myself self and my dad were discussing the night and laughing about it when he said that apparently person two was being cuddly to distract me from person one. this didn't immediately say anything to me, but between then and me messaging them earlier tonight it started to grow on me. it soon reached me messaging them about my head, and I also mentioned that I heard about the planned hugging. to abbreviate what they said they were actually quite uncomfortable about what happened and didn't want to make things awkward between us by saying so, so I asked person two to make sure nothing stupid happened. again, what happened was clearly my fault and ill hold my hands up to it, but my problem lies with the fact I now have to think about what I trust. can I trust my friends to be honest with me, can I trust myself to not take things to far? can I trust that I'm not going to depend on people and that I'm not going to cause harm around me? how do I go about this?",

  "Post": "Oh God. This will be a long one. It's crush problems. Yuck. I've never liked romantic movies or books, they always disgusted me. And kissing was way worse! It made me nauseous to think about any type of kissing or anything romantic. I know, I know, I should grow up. I'm just so bothered , though! I did have a crush, though. I was 10. We were friends at first and then got to know each other. He was caring and surprisingly mature for a 10 year old! Anyways, he kind of flirted with me. I still thought it was gross. I followed him around a lot and one day I asked if he promised to be my boyfriend and marry me. He said yes. It was cute, buy then we got older and just forgot about it. We didn't like each other anymore. It wasn't a dramatic breakup, we were 10! Now I'm 14. Never had a crush since, although we are still friends and hang out at lunch. As friends. I'm still kind of disgusted by relationships, although I'm waiting for when I won't be. One day I was texting someone because we had to work on a library project together. I had never met her in person, buy she seemed pretty cool. In my mind, we bonded immediately. We both had a lot in common: we both drew anime, both loved cooking, and hated relationships. We both thought we were too young for relationships, we were still children, after all! And I was disturbed whenever I thought about 4 years ago. Anywho, we planned the whole thing for the book fair and that was that. Never saw each other, never hung out or texting again, until the next week when we planned to meet up and discuss the book fair. When we got there, I was horrified. I saw her and I completely lost it! She was so perfect looking, and her smile was so kind. I'd never even seen her before, but I acted as if we had been friends for ages. I was completely obsessed with her, I practically stalked her. It scared me a lot. I could barely speak when I was around her. I had dreams about her when we were in romantic relationships. I know this all sounds like I have a huge crush on someone, but actually, it confuses me. I wasn't lesbian. At least, I didn't think so. Relationships disgust me, so I never even thought about my sexuality. It can't be a real crush. I still can't decide if I like her in that way! We only talked for about a day on text, and when we met up in person we barely looked each other in the eye. She doesn't really say \"hi\" to me when we're at school and she never texts me. Ever. We are hardly friends, we're just acquainted and have to work on a school project. I feel so pathetic. I want to see her so badly! I don't know what to do. Please help!\nSincerely, \nMe UwU",

  "Post": "Ok so i just posted it but i reread it and it was really confusing so I am going to retype it. \n\nMe ( F 19) and my friend M ( M 17) have been friends for about 9 years. I had a crush on him for a good amount of time and he recently got in a relationship with V , a mutually friend. At the beginning of their relationship i acted out of jealousy and i was very cold to her. After a little i realized my mistake and i talked to her about this. I never told her that i had feelings for him but i apologized for my rude behavior. I thought she accepted my apology but for about 2 months of trying to talk to her and hang out with her she would just ignore me so i gave up. During christmas i decided to throw a small get together and i decided to invite M but not V. Before i sent out invites i asked him if this was okay and he understood and said that it was okay. After about a week M and V were being kinda rude to me and i asked him what was up and he said she was really hurt that you didnt invite her. I was confused because she had actively ignored me for over 2 months. I apologized to her and invited her to my party. That same week our mutual friends N (F 18) and S (18) told me that she decided to throw her own party on the same day and invite all the people i invited to mine plus more. I just decided to cancel my get together to try to get away from the situation. After this situation i tried again to become friends with V and her friend K (f 18), K and me were really close but she has been pooling away lately. Everything i tried got denied and i was sick of it. I didnt tell M, N, or S this was happening because i didnt want to ruin their relationship with K and V. A month ago N and S came to me and told me that V and K were talking crap about all of us ( me, N and S ) I wasnt that hurt because i expected this but it really hurt N and S because they were closer to them. we tried to get over it and make things better between us but it didnt work. \n2 weeks ago we all went on a trip to disney with our band and of course we were all put together in a room. Me , V, K, S, N, and my new friend E (f 16). We all tried to include V and K into things we did but they ignored us. During the trip we really wanted to hang out with M but V is a super jealous girlfriend so we thought it was better to not talk to anyone in her group. M thought we were mad at him but i explained why after the trip. V and K told M that we were the ones ignoring them. This got me frustrated because they were ignoring us the whole time and they were whispering about us in our room. Me, S, and N are so frustrated with what is happening and we decided to talk to M. He was curious why all his friends were leaving him and we felt like it would be better to tell him what is happening. He suggest all of us (including V and K) talk together and my group agreed. M was talking to V about this and she got pissed at him and yelled at him for talking to us. \nLately me N, and S have stepped away from the group just to get rid of all the drama. But to day things happened. S's birthday is coming up so she sent invites and since her and V and K are not in good standing she didnt invite them (also should be known that they didnt invite her to their party), but she did invite M. V found this out today and is no longer talking to anyone and she is putting M in a hard situation. It is like she wants him to pick his friends or her. Seeing all my friends so upset and sad really gets to me and i need fix this. I am moving far away in 3 months and i would really love to leave knowing that there is no bad blood. Please help if you can. Thank you \n\nalso sorry for the long feed",

  "Post": "This season is coming up and starting in 3 weeks. I still donÃ¢??t know if IÃ¢??m playing and IÃ¢??ve been thinking for the past 3 months and been unable to decide. I am in desperate need of some help\n\nSummary of my situation:\nIÃ¢??m a sophomore this year and I was the only pitcher on my team last year. I was overworked and got an injury near the end of last season from repetitive motion in my shoulder. I went to PT all fall\/winter and still canÃ¢??t pitch or throw without pain. Anyway, last year I was miserable and was under so much pressure to constantly perform perfectly. The coach was also mean. I started to lose interest in softball, the sport IÃ¢??ve been playing for 10 years. A lot of my friends are on the team too and I donÃ¢??t want to let them down. IÃ¢??ve talked to my coach and there most likely arenÃ¢??t any other positions for me on the team, other than bench, since I canÃ¢??t really pitch. \n\n\nI need to decide wether or not to play this season. I honestly canÃ¢??t make a decision and nobody is really helping me. I am being persuaded to play by everyone I talk to (including my parents). My parents keep telling me to do it and sit on the sidelines all season and be a Ã¢??team player.Ã¢?Â I get how this is important, but it seems like such a waste of time to me if IÃ¢??m going to be committing so much time to just observe.\n\n\nReasons I donÃ¢??t want to play: \n- IÃ¢??m worried about my shoulder and making it worse. \n- I hated it last year and didnÃ¢??t have fun. \n- It was too stressful. \n- It took up all of my free time 6 days a week for 3 months. \n- I would have to quit my job that IÃ¢??ve been working for 3 weeks at. \n- I wouldnÃ¢??t be able to focus on my hobbies or school \n- I would be happier and better mentally. \n\n\nReasons I want to play\/things holding me back from quitting: \n- My friends are on the team and I might feel left out\/ regret quitting \n- things might be better this year \n- IÃ¢??ve been playing for such a long time and idk if IÃ¢??m ready to let go. \n- I donÃ¢??t want to piss my friends off and let down the team. \n- I would walk by my coach everyday and have a really awkward time in her gym class senior year. \n- I wouldnÃ¢??t see a lot of my friends often. (IÃ¢??m kind of introverted and donÃ¢??t have many friends, so it would be hard for me to go out and make new ones)\n- I would feel very bad for quitting and leaving the team to struggle. \n\n\nIf anyone is still reading this and has anything to say, I would really really like to hear another perspective. Especially from someone who isnÃ¢??t biased one way.",

Which I didnÃ¢??t, besides one, the girl who bashed me, and it was more like criticism because she has been doing lots of bad stuff recently, and all the others had been talking about her too. But I didnÃ¢??t talk about the others.\n\nOn Sunday I get a dm from my best friend, saying that I shit talked her according to problematic friend, not to deny it because she know what I had said, how I better be careful what I do next and how it really hurt. I thought back to see if I remember doing so, which I didnÃ¢??t. Got a bit mad and explained I had not done so, which didnÃ¢??t garner a response. \n\nI send the dm to my other best friend, who said she believes that problematic friend is trying to both kick her and I out of the friend group, and I agree. However she comes back with a dm from the previous friend explaining that I had also shit talked about her?? Which I also knew I hadnÃ¢??t. Confused. I said that yet again, I didnÃ¢??t, and I get left on seen, twice. So then I asked the problematic friend nicely at first whether she had said that I shit talked my friends to them. She denied, and instantly said Ã¢??I donÃ¢??t need your bullshit, fix this yourselfÃ¢?Â and stuff like that, even though first friend explicitly said that problematic girl says this.\n\n\nI leave it be, and announce how IÃ¢??m leaving the group as I had other friends that treated me better, and I didnÃ¢??t need toxicity and how they didnÃ¢??t listen to me. No response either. Whatever, I guess. Then today came, and problematic girl told my boyfriend that I was to be bashed. She sees me, and starts yelling obscurities, and I told her to piss off. She comes up to me, and I try to de-escalate by saying how I didnÃ¢??t want to fight, and how I wouldnÃ¢??t hit her, and we could talk about this normally, to no avail, she threw a punch to which I blocked. However IÃ¢??m a really really weak fighter, so I lost, she threw me to the ground and I just shielded myself as she threw punches at me and kicked and pushes, left school after that with all the kids laughing and filming.\n\n\nI know IÃ¢??m not in the wrong. The situation they brought up where I supposedly talked shit was misunderstood by a metric fuck ton. \nI went to get books from my locker, friends ditched me, and I was too tired to look for them. So I found problematic girl and her friend, sat with them for a bit.

I had some time to think over things, I realized that I was feeling so low and sad for the last two days *after* he told me about this other girl.\n\nI don't know.

After I'd moved on (or at least I tought I had) I dated his best friend for 4 days, but then I realized I didn't have any feelings for him, so I broke up with him. Since, he's said that he was over me, and we're still good friends. Now everything is the same between us. We're a month later in the present and I've fallen in love with the first guy again. I had no idea what to do. One evening he was left alone with me on discord. We were talking about our lovelives and how we were both really unlucky. I said if neather of us would succeed, let's go on a date. He said not that he wouldn't want to, but he wouldn't date his best friend's ex. Do you think his opinion could change?

He is really funny, nice, has the same music taste as me, makes amazing music, plays instruments (including saxophone like ahh i love sax so much its so preeetty), apparently has a really great family, has some of the same friends as me, is v cute oops, gave me butterflies for the first time (i thought that was a made up thing wtf), and more. So after posting on my spam account that I didnt want to like him anymore because im too awkward, one of mine and his friends said that i should do something because he wont be in my school next year. SO  I did probably the most brave thing ive ever done (im not brave if you couldnt tell ahha) and went up to him in person in front of all of his friends and spoke to him i was so nervous lmao; the full palms sweaty moms spaghetti. I then spoke to him after and he was so nice to me and ah. Its just that we havent spoken since and its too awkward to talk in person (he literally said to me \"sorry if it was awkward\" so, well...). So if you couldnt tell by now im 1.a naturally nervous person 2.someone whos never been in a relationship or anything like that. I dont know what to do now. We dont sit next to each other in class, and ive been told i give off a very shy vibe but then when you get to know me im surprisingly talkative (just dunno how to get to the point where he knows that because he makes me 10x more nervous than I already would be). Its weird because I always think to myself that nothing could ever happen between us but then there will be times where ill see him looking at me and that one time he spoke to me he was giving me loads of compliments (things that friends do too so i should stfu ahah) but like honestly id be just as happy just being his friend he seems like a great friend. Do you have any advice on how to actually talk to him properly in person and not just every once in a while over dms?",

And he didn't actually get it in my vagina, but he fucked my thighs until he came I think, or he stopped cause it wasn't working. I've pushed it out of my memory. And I went home like almost right after. And the whole way home I was wondering if I should tell my mom. Then like a few weeks later I'm like, I don't wanna date you, I don't like you like that, and then he started being an ass hole. I was worried he was gonna tell everyone, so I told my friend (Let's call them Alex) what happened because I didn't know what to call it, she said it was rape. So I told one of my \"friends\" about it because I didn't know what to do because the more I thought about it and the more I saw him the more I wanted to fucking die. Someone overheard me saying it to Alex, and started spreading that I was going around telling everyone I was raped by the guy, then I looked into it more and was like. I guess it was just assault. So I said to everyone, \"no he pressured me into it, I think it was sexual assault\" but I didn't wanna press charges and go through all that because it would of gone no where. And now, 2 years later , this one girl, is still fucking talking about it. Saying \"I don't like them because they lied about rape and someone heard them confessing they lied about it over the technician's headset.\" \n\nI don't want to be confrontational to the girl who's saying this about me, but I don't know what to do.

As time went on I wasnÃ¢??t doing well in my classes and stoped showing up to Lectures. My job got terrible and the boss gave no shits about how the work environment was. About 6 months after the divorce my parents made up and got back together. I wanted to be happy about it but It was still tough for me. I felt like I had no where to go and I felt I needed to work to be useful, my classes were going awful cause I never showed up, and I lost interest in all my hobbies. (I had planned a couple a days during this time when I was going to overdose but I couldnÃ¢??t bring myself to do it) Eventually my parents noticed my health state and decided it was time for me to leave my job. 3 weeks after quitting I have got back into my Art (this is my career choice my major is Graphic Design) and started joining art shows. My parents support my art but they are now saying they didnÃ¢??t want me to quit my job because I do nothing around the house and sleep all day. Since quitting my job I have done more in the few weeks for my career than I have done in the whole year, I have been going to my classes again, and when I can I clean the house and make food for the family (It May not be spotless cleaning but it is enough to make the house look nice) I tried telling my mom and she felt betrayed that I didnÃ¢??t tell her I was having problems with school and stuff before I quit my job and she is mad at me for not saying anything. I donÃ¢??t know if I should tell my mom how messed up my mental state is right now and how it has been because she will feel betrayed but I donÃ¢??t want to disappoint them either. Are there any tips on how I can motivate myself to do more and be more useful rahter than doing the stuff that just helps me? Should I go back to work to be useful again",

  "Post": "I'm a sophomore in high school and I've been struggling with a tough decision for a few months now.\n\nI haven't played school sports until this year, and I picked up running cross country and track and field. Since I started in late August, I have progressed from pretty awful, to the point where I am competing at varsity meets. I show lots of future potential (I seriously have improved a lot, which I am happy with). The high school I go to is top 3 for running in the entire state, which is already a competitive one, and I just made varsity. At this particular school, those who run are *somewhat* obligated to run all three seasons, meaning cross country and both track seasons. My coach is quite pleased with how I've improved, and my parents are off the walls about running this and running that since I have gotten pretty good, and no one ever really thought of me as that great of an athlete. So, physically speaking, my life is dedicated at the moment to continue improving as a runner. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, I have high hopes for the future which aren't running related, and involve me showing that I can be a good athlete. Hence, I need one or more varsity letters to apply to specific colleges. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the thing is, over the course of this year I have gotten to the point where I just about hate running. I've lost 10 pounds while trying to maintain my weight (I didn't really have any weight to lose and I wasn't half-assing my effort to stay the same size, either), I have gotten weaker, and I feel like a pussy for it. It sounds stupid, but for the longest time I have absolutely loved lifting weights and training my physique. At this point, I know for a fact that I could continue where I am going, but I will genuinely hate the way I am; a sacrifice to be an elite-level runner. I have decided personally that it's just not worth it, and I want to finish this outdoor track season, but I don't want to run cross country. And after that: I would like to do wrestling in the winter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy school has a great wrestling program, and I have always wanted to try wrestling, but I haven't done it before. The coach is notorious for being a tough guy with tougher workouts, and that's what I would want to do more than anything: a combative sport where I can get stronger, instead of a sport that I am good at but hate doing. I have spoken to people on the team and they all said, for what word of mouth is worth, that I would make the team since I'm a pretty small guy (118 lbs and 5'6) but am strong and lean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea how to really tell my parents that running isn't something that I am invested in anymore, and on top of that, I want to start something brand new. I think I want to wait until after the track season to tell them (so in mid-may). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice on, if you can tell, I made the right decision: Do what I want to do, not what I am good at but dislike? And any advice on how to break it to my parents who won't shut up about my future in running? P.S. they are pretty supportive of any decisions, but I have never dropped a bomb like this before.",

This starts with a crush on an exchange guy, he also liked me at the start of the school year but I wasn't aware of it. \nI don't know how to process feelings, I just don't realize I like someone until it's too late, so ofc even though I smiled every time I saw him and all  that cheesy shit I just wasn't aware.\nEnter other guy, this one was making his move, he was shooting his shot with me and wasn't afraid to be obvious so I went with it cause, \"yeah, why not? it's easy ik he likes me and I'm sort of attracted to him, yh sure let's do it. \" BAD IDEA ( turns out he's an asshole I ended it quick). This made the 1stguy who I actually wanted, give up on me and start talking to some girl, a week or so later they're dating... yay. \n\nFast foward 2months later, 1st guy and me are at a party, his girlfriend isn't there we're a little tipsy and he pulls me away from the rest and tells me he had a big crush on me at the start of the school year. WHY WOULD U TELL ME THAT?!?! WHAT'S THE POINT?!? THAT'S JUST SELFISH. But anyway, that night we talked about the whole thing until we fell asleep... in each others arms, we basically cuddled and then something happened but, we didn't kiss or make out we just kind of touched eachother, he was incredibly cute about it he was asking me if I was okay or comfortable etc. After that we didn't even mention it, well just casually said  we remembered everything between 3am and 7am which is when all that happened. \n\nA month or so later there's another party, and again we cuddled and we danced and he pulled me in by the waist etc. Next day all he does is talk about his \"ex-girlfriend\" (they broke up but they still talk and they're pretty much still together) TO ME AND IN FRONT OF ME.\n\nWhen she's there he completely ignores me, but ofc at a party without anyone that knows her it's all good WTF. IM SO CONFUSED AND I HATE SEEING THEM TOGETHER. \n\nMy questions, \nAm I being played?\nShould I completely stop talking to him?\nWhat tf is going on?\nWe haven't talked about any of this and I'm so mad at him, I want to give him a piece of my mind  but I can't.",

We flirted fo a solid HOUR then he says hes going to sleep, cool thats how we usually end our conversations cause we talk for a while, anyway a few hours have passed, and the absolute wooorst heaviness in my chest, and guilt set in, because i was finally like \"oh fuck\" cause i didnt want to hurt him but i wanted to rip the band aid off so i wouldn't lead him on, sooo i kinda end up texting him a fucking essay basically saying im sorry for getting caught up in the moment and i hope we can still be friends yada yada yada, And. Then. I. Block.him., like Wtf how shitty is that?!?! Ughh anyways i un block him, he also blocked me, i was depressed for months, i contacted him through other means, and we start talking again and it was like we never stopped talking. \n\nANYWAY we are super cool he has a girlfriend cassy (such a sweetheart) and i have tried dating but i still feel too guilty and i worry that ill do that to someone else unintentionally and hurt them!!!\n\n:TLDR: I want to get back into dating but i feel guilty and i dont know how to stop feeling so guilty, like i can feel guilty for not getting through the level in panda pop because the pandas were in the buble too long, and it takes at least a hour to stop feeling bad so i dont know how to stop feeling guilty about this\n\n\nAlso im sorry i rant so much\n\nOh and me and him call this the \"incident\" or \"what happened\" and joke about it",

I go to a super preppy, expensive as hell, private school (got in on a partial scholarship). You can probably expect that thereÃ¢??s not that much diversity, which is where my first problem arises. IÃ¢??ve heard a lot of people talk about this before where they Ã¢??find their peopleÃ¢?? but there is not a single other person in my grade who looks or talks like me. I donÃ¢??t feel in place at all.\n On top of that, school has been really stressful recently. I havenÃ¢??t been doing poorly, but itÃ¢??s super stressful. It seems like these things are temporary problems but I feel like the reality is that it continues throughout high school if I donÃ¢??t address it, and maybe it might chase me for the rest of my life. \n\nOh, and on top of all that, I have some serious problems at home on both sides of my family. My sister is super spoiled (goes to the same school, but has been there for longer) and she has lost all respect for our parents who sent her there. SheÃ¢??s just plain nasty to them and it hurts me. Also, my uncle on my momÃ¢??s side is struggling with obesity and had a heart issue recently (heÃ¢??s in the hospital rn), and my uncle on my dadÃ¢??s side is an extreme alcoholic whoÃ¢??s had liver failure and probably gonna die before his parents.\n\nMeanwhile iÃ¢??m stuck in between all this.

I used to be so excited to see texts from him and to meet up with him but it feels like all that magic has been fading recently. We used to never run out of things to talk about but lately I feel like IÃ¢??ve been having much less fun around him and I feel like I donÃ¢??t have anything interesting to say. It just doesnÃ¢??t feel right anymore. However, he is such a nice guy and I donÃ¢??t want to lose him. He has no idea I feel this way and is constantly telling me how perfect for him I am and how much he loves me but it just doesnÃ¢??t feel true when I say I love you back. He is so good to me and IÃ¢??m so so lucky to have him but I feel like itÃ¢??s not fair to stay with him when IÃ¢??m not invested in this relationship anymore. It scares me how heÃ¢??s so committed too. HeÃ¢??s openly told me that he can see a real future with me and that without me his life would be meaningless and he would have no one. I told him at the time this was crazy and he is valued by so many people, but I know that breaking up with him would shatter him. Like really break him. HeÃ¢??s not super close to many other people but weÃ¢??re sort of in the same friend group so itÃ¢??ll be awkward for us to break up. To be honest i feel stuck. If I donÃ¢??t break up with him then I wonÃ¢??t be happy and IÃ¢??ll just think about this all the time, but if I do then he will take it really badly and IÃ¢??m so afraid of being lonely. IÃ¢??ve known him for about 3 years altogether and I feel as though IÃ¢??m too used to having him\/IÃ¢??m reliant on him. IÃ¢??m terrified of being lonely and regretting it if I break up with him. Being with him is all IÃ¢??ve known for so long and I think losing him would feel like such a hole in my life. I value having him around and heÃ¢??s so supportive when IÃ¢??m down.

Im in year 10 this year, living in Australia and iÃ¢??m currently going to an all boys school. I have good friends there and I enjoy it well enough but iÃ¢??m worried that it might not be the best for me for my final two years of school for these reasons\n1 - Subjects\nIÃ¢??ve been told by some older friends that the subject selection isnÃ¢??t great and that if you pick one subject you canÃ¢??t pick the other which screws everything up and also the teachers and curriculum is average at best unless you get lucky with a great teacher and at the school i want to go to it looks like the subjects are a lot better.\n2 - Religious School\nThe school I am currently at is catholic and I am not completely apposed to going to one it takes up a lot of time when we have mass and Religious Education is a compulsory subject through all years and it is a really dull subject with really bad and boring teachers. Also annoying little touch, where I live gets really cold during winter and all we are allowed to where are these crappy thin pants with no ability to keep anything warm and the uniform is overall bad.\n3 - Social Skills\nThis is a big problem for me right now but IÃ¢??m really bad socially. I have friends  and I know how to talk and make friends but i havenÃ¢??t been to a co-ed school for over 6 years and I never really talked to girls then anyway. I feel like if I stay at this school I am going to not know how to talk to girls properly and not have good social skills in general. I donÃ¢??t have any social media besides reddit and donÃ¢??t like to use it anyway and I donÃ¢??t know any ways I can meet girls otherwise.\n\nMy parents donÃ¢??t care what school I go to they just want me to be happy and arenÃ¢??t really religious. I really like the look of this knew school and if I can manage to get in I think I might go bit any advice would be much appreciated. My parents left it completely up to me",

  "Post": "Alright so hereÃ¢??s the thing. IÃ¢??m a (F) in highschool and my best friend is also a (F) in highschool. WeÃ¢??ve been close for a few years but in 8th grade, I started to question my true feelings for her. I thought nothing of it really at first but when we went roller skating with our friends, thatÃ¢??s when I realized she may mean something more to me. We did the couples skate because that was the last skate of the night and we didnÃ¢??t want to stop skating. We had to hold hands the whole time because that was the rule to do the final skate. I felt really nervous for Ã¢??some reasonÃ¢?Â but again, didnÃ¢??t think much of it. In 9th grade, things got interesting. She shared some really personal stuff with me, one thing being that she was confused about her sexuality and everything. She even said that she thought she liked one of our friends (F). That night, I did something bravely stupid. I almost kissed her. I got closer and closer but I ended up not going through with it cause I didnÃ¢??t want to ruin our friendship or anything. At this point, she thought I was straight which confused her even more. After that night, she texted me as soon as I left saying that she missed me and everything, we also shared overnight phone calls moving on after that. Long story short, things were revealed and she implied that she might feel the same way that I thought I felt about her. This little flirtatious and leading on stage went on for a few weeks. All changed after she Ã¢??talked to a school counselorÃ¢?Â and revealed that they said she was just confused. She told me this of course after I fully confessed how I really felt which took a lot. She sent me really long paragraphs basically praising me and saying that she needs me in her life basically. After that, she started acting a little differently towards me and I noticed right away. She wasnÃ¢??t as touchy and she just treated me very differently overall. It made me really sad. We had a sleepover with our other friend and we had a 4am Ã¢??confessionÃ¢?Â time and she revealed that she doesnÃ¢??t wanna be gay but she doesnÃ¢??t know her sexuality. She also revealed that she thinks or thought she liked this one guy in her class. After our friend fell asleep, I started blabbering and talked about that night and basically revealed that that night was messing me up and IÃ¢??ve been feeling a certain way ever since. She acted like she was asleep for a while but after I put a blanket over her, she said very sleepily, Ã¢??you shouldÃ¢??ve just done itÃ¢?Â of course I was shocked and like so confused. That all messed me up even more. She started acting so distant after that confession night and she ended up taking a break from me and our other friend all summer. The WHOLE summer. No contact with us at all. It was later revealed when she came back into my life that it was partly because of me and everything that happened. A guy friend of ours that just recently came into our lives (whom she had feeling for apparently) helped us kinda get closure from that whole situation but IÃ¢??m still left sad. Ever since sheÃ¢??s been back, sheÃ¢??s been acting more like how it used to be. Overnight calls every night, she wants to hang out all the time, engages with me, all touchy and stuff. I feel like thereÃ¢??s no way she doesnÃ¢??t at least feel the same even a little bit. Not with everything weÃ¢??ve been through and everything we continue to go through. IÃ¢??m still confused on my feelings for her constantly but I know that I love her. I donÃ¢??t know if itÃ¢??s in a different way than a best friend but itÃ¢??s a strong feeling. I get jealous and upset and sometimes mad at her for no reason which I feel really bad about...what do I do and what does this all mean??",

Her parents are not her real parents keep in mind.  \n\nThe children there have a  certain age and requirement to have a phone which is fine. ItÃ¢??s 16 and you have to have a job to pay for phone bills. ThatÃ¢??s fine by my standards. \n\nHowever, my friend had turned that age and she has a job at a local store. So she does have the funds to pay their phone bill and they have do WiFi at home. She was finally given her phone and we were able to text easily.  \n\nTexting is easier than having to physically walk over to the place (which is a mile away) and see if sheÃ¢??s home.  \n\nAge had their phone for a while until it was taken away for no reason. They didnÃ¢??t misbehave or anything (this is isnt the first time something like that this happened IÃ¢??ll explain further). They had came over to my house, their sibling comes with her every time they come over.  Which is strange because thereÃ¢??s no one around their age to play with any of my siblings.  ItÃ¢??s really weird.  My two younger brothers are two young to play with the sibling while my two older siblings are older.  \n\nI had asked about her phone and they said it was taken away for no reason. I asked if she had misbehaved possibly and she said no.  She said her parents decided to take away her phone despite meeting their requirements of the ability to have a phone.  \n\nThen I asked what if thereÃ¢??s like an emergency and you need a phone (they drives alone to work late at night around 10 in a rural ghetto sorta neighborhood.) she had stated that her parents told her if it happened she should knock on every door to get help which is totally unsafe for a 16 year old girl to go to strangers houses let alone at around 10 PM.  However the houses are like at least a mile apart in this area.   \n\nShe then told me another story where her headlights had once gone out.  She didnÃ¢??t have a flashlight or a phone for that matter, she had to drive on the pitch black.  \n\nAnother case where I suspect abuse is once I was over at her house, one of their kids (who has a problem) had wet their pants.  They began to scream at them for wetting his pants and told him to wash up. However I read that like screaming at young children for wetting their pants is bad. However this kid is slightly older. \n\nAnother was I invited her to see a Disney movie. Her parents agreed to let her go the day before.  She was excited since she had wanted to see the movie. \nNext day we go to pick her up and she has tears in her eyes saying she couldnÃ¢??t go at all. Later a few days ago I went to her house and asked about the movie.  She stated she didnÃ¢??t get in trouble and her parents decided to not let her see the movie. \n\n\nSo basically having a phone is good for safety. What if she got into a car crash? She couldnÃ¢??t call for help. Even a. Flip up phone could be used but she doesnÃ¢??t have that. I wouldnÃ¢??t want my future 16 year old daughter walk at night all alone or drive at night alone with creepy people who are out there in the world.",

  "Post": "Hi. I would like to share my story of my toxic relationship. I am creating this post to inspire people who know deep down they need to leave a relationship but think they don't have the courage, or think they will regret it. \n\nI currently will be turning 20 next month (I'm female). when I was 17, I started dating this guy. I was really into him. \n\nSoon enough, he began telling me things to make me jealous. he would tell me when he thought girls were attractive, he told me there was a cute girl in his class that he considered being with instead, and that there was a girl in another class who would always stare at him and that he began to have feelings for her but was \"fighting it off.\" he told me I had to be more enthusiastic over text, or else he would start having feelings for other girls. once he even told me he \"would be tempted to hang out with other girls\" if I went to visit my friend at college. He told me he was having feelings of breaking up with me, but was trying to fight them off, putting the burden on me to help him figure it out. He has made me cry COUNTLESS times. each time I did bring it up, and he would start crying and tell me he was sorry and that he did care for me, and that he was tempted to harm himself if I broke up with him. I KNEW deep down that I should break it off, but I didn't want to. It was my very first relationship and I thought I might regret it if I broke up with him. I really thought this was the person I was going to end up with. Hell was I wrong. \n\nEvery terrible thing he has told me, he would say, \"I promise I didn't say it to make you jealous\" and then after a while, he would confess and say he did, indeed, say it for that reason. He would tell me I need to show more physical affection, and that because of this, he is tempted to date others. That's fine, that he wants someone who shows more physical affection, but it's a shitty thing to do to put the burden on me and making me feel like I need to fix that part of myself. It was things like this that made me feel bad about who I was. I was incredibly stressed out over these things he constantly told me. I lost sleep, and I stopped caring about pretty much everything else. all I wanted was for him to accept me as I was, but instead he was constantly putting me down and making me feel absolutely worthless. \n\nMy dad was my hero with this. We went to a target parking lot and I cried and he comforted me. \n\nFrom this shit show of a relationship, I have trust issues, a heightened anxiety, and overall regret and frustration. I am so angry that I let him do all that to me, and this is why I am posting this. if you are experiencing a similar thing, PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR GUT. The entire time, my gut was telling me \"end this now. End this now. End this now.\" but I didn't listen. It was my first relationship, and I truly thought we would last forever, even though my gut told me I was not doing the smart thing. I KNEW this was a bad idea to continue on with this person. I KNEW no one should treat me this way. \n\nAnd last thing. Let me tell you. Now, looking back on it, it is INSANE to realize how differently I feel. I am so secure with my decision. Once I left him, it was like a breath of fresh air. It took some time, of course; it took a few weeks, but once I truly realized it, it's like I can't believe I ever wanted to stay with him. When you're in the stage of \"I am infatuated with this person; I want to work it out with them\" you really do not realize how much better it will feel letting them go. But when you're out of that stage for a while, after breaking it off, you truly realize what a wonderful decision you've made. Never again will I let someone treat me this way. This was definitely a learning lesson in my life. So once again, please, if you're experiencing something similar, PLEASE follow what your gut says and if you're being treated wrongly like I was, END IT NOW. I promise, you will NOT regret it. I really hope this inspires just one person. feel free to pm me if you want to chat.",

I hated every single year of my life in school. I hated school so much that I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Now IÃ¢??m at a smaller school and trying to recover credits. I like to believe IÃ¢??m usually a really nice guy but I know I have anger issues with others and especially to my self. I donÃ¢??t have a problem talking to people I donÃ¢??t know but either IÃ¢??m not motivated to do so because everything is good for a bit but shit usually always goes south. People make me feel shitty I wish I could spend the rest of my life locked away. Maybe I can have the courage to end it one day but I know my family loves me. Life just feels like complete bs. I understand why people donÃ¢??t last long around me. If I could leave me I would too. Never dated, was bullied and constantly I get reminded of everything IÃ¢??m not and everything I havenÃ¢??t done\nEdit: I also have a bad porn addiction because it seems to be the only thing that makes me feel better yet I tell myself to stop but I relapse.

  "Post": "Ok the title is pretty funny ngl but I actually need your guyÃ¢??s opinion on this serious matter.\n\nBackground: i am a senior in high school and i just got my braces taken off a few months ago after having them for like 6 years. I also do not have my upper left incisor tooth (the one right next to your front tooth) because my mouth was too small and it had to get pulled. \n\nSo when I got my braces off, I had to get a retainer with a bar across the front of my teeth with a tooth attached (so It looked like I still have all my teeth).  I didnÃ¢??t mind the retainer too much bc I figured i could live with the bar across my teeth for a month for so. Then, my doctor just told me that I will have to wait until the end of April to get my actual implant so I will have to keep the retainer with the bar across the front until then.\n\nI hate to smile with my teeth and I am very self conscious about having my retainer in all the time. I realize this sounds stupid but I just feel like the only person in the world that has to wear a retainer and that doesnÃ¢??t have a perfect, metal free mouth. And again, I know it might sound dumb but this retainer really impacts my self confidence. I thought that when I got my braces off, my hatred for my smile would stop, but now that I am supposed to wear this for longer makes me want to cry.\n\nAlthough, my doctor gave me the option of keeping the retainer with the bar across the  front of the teeth for the next 3 months OR getting a retainer without a bear across the front with a tooth still attached but for $250\n\nI do have the money (my parents arenÃ¢??t paying for it) but I worry that IÃ¢??m spending a lot of money on something that I will use for 3 months only. BUT I am going to a trip to London and Paris in the beginning of April and I really really do not want to go there looking and feeling like this.\n\nSo, I need to decide if I should keep my retainer with the bar across the teeth OR buy the $250 one without the bar?\n\nPls tell me what you would do!!!!",

My friend's bf told her about this and once she heard this, she has been very down lately, but she thinks she needs to confront them about talking about her behind her back to her bf. However, once getting advice from her bf, he told her not to tell them about it, because that would only create more drama, and he thinks it would backfire. What should my friend do, because she's decided to dm them, but realized that talking them in person would be easier, but she's very introverted so she wouldn't know how to confront them.",

  "Post": "I just started crying in front of my mom today for several reasons but none of which my mom thinks it is. I might think nothing of this tomorrow and will probably delete this post tomorrow but for now, I need a source to get it out somewhere so I can study.\n\n  \nI come from an old school Korean background so it's typical for moms to not really listen to personal stories of their children unless under VERY special circumstances. My mom is pretty nice and unique so she likes to be more friend-like with me so we talk (one way) to each other a lot (and I'm an only child so things can get boring). I like to tell my mom frustrating stories of my friends which I empathize about because it's fun and sometimes helpful to hear her opinion. She rarely does give any comments to any of my stories. My mom's not the type of person who speaks a few words, in fact, she talks a lot. The problem is she likes to talk a lot about things she wants to according to her mood. I've always been matching myself to riding her tide in a conversation and I feel like that habit gets her into some trouble at work. \n\n  \nRecently, I've been \\*blossoming\\* into my late teens and my relationship with my mom has gotten better. Amid my puberty, we were literally at each others' necks (ok, well, to be fair she entered menopause too). When I'm giving her one of my stories of the day, the glint in her eye tells me she's somewhere else in her world. I don't know if it is because I'm still immature or not, but I find this unfair. For years I've been listening to her stories whether I liked it or not but that's not exactly the reason why I'm upset. My mom likes to do many activities after work, like exercising, shopping and learning more English (through Netflix shows). I'm totally okay with my mom wanting to do the activities she wants to do but I just wish she would listen to some of my stories. I never ask her to listen to what I'm stressing about at school because that makes me more stressed out, but I just want her to listen to one of my random stories. This really helps out a lot. On purpose, I try not to talk to her when she's busy doing something at home or when she's enjoying her free time. I only try to talk to her when we're finishing off dinner and that's when she's in her greatest mood. For all the Asians out there, you might tell me to suck it up, but I really don't have anyone to talk to because this kind of links to family stuff that I don't want to share and my dad worked far away since I was small so I don't feel any connections to him (all he talks about, IF he does, is world history which is probably inaccurate on his side).  \nI've tried to seriously talk to my mom about it, but she would make a huge turn in the conversation and scold me for something recently I did wrong, which is always linked to Korean manners and I always don't understand what I did wrong because I was born in Canada. \n\n  \nI know talking about this sounds like boasting but compared to other kids I don't really ask for much (although I should ask myself about why my marks are like that in school). I earn my own spending money and the only time I really get anything from my parents is during Christmas and my birthday (and those two are in close proximity so I really just get one big gift). This excludes the afterschool activities I go to and the very few vacations I went on when I was younger.  \nMy mom likes to focus on how much money she spends on me because I go to extra math classes after school. What I really want is for her to realize my mental health would do so much better if she could listen to my random (maybe boring) stories once every day for a maximum of 15 mins.\n\n  \nOh, and my mom only listens to me when I give her advice about socializing at work (she's bad at it and she admits it too). I really don't like that because my mom knows I have scarring memories from fRiEnDs using me as an advice bot. \n\n  \nHow can I get the message across to my mom that I need a little time to vent in front of her?",

HeÃ¢??s always yelling at me and he rarely ever smiles. \nHe is always grumpy and angry and he never ask anything in a polite way, he just starts yelling at me that I shouldÃ¢??ve done something, even if I did something else (like chore) or if IÃ¢??m injured (walking hurts due to my knee being hurt). \nHeÃ¢??s always been somewhat aggressive towards me and my brother but IÃ¢??ve always been the one he seems to care the least about. He scares me sometimes as well. \nI genuinely feel like he doesnÃ¢??t care about me because I have the same character as he does, and my family feels like he does not like it as well. \nCan somebody please give advice?\n\nPs. \nSorry for the weird sentence-things but IÃ¢??m not sure what to write.",

Mind you I always have a lot of homework due to the fact that IÃ¢??m in high school and take many advanced classes. Anyways across the hall to my room is my brothers room. He is 14 and games. He was non stop talking very loudly to his friends on the mic and periodically yelling. I donÃ¢??t have a door and neither does he so, I could here everything clear. I had asked him nicely to stop 2 or three times. He ignored I even said anything. Then I yelled for him to be quiet. My mother heard me yell and starting yelling at me to stop from downstairs to stop and that I was breeching her peace and to be quiet. I explained I was trying to do my homework and my brother wasnÃ¢??t being quiet at all. She said he can play the Xbox whenever he wants and told me not to do my homework the last minute. She was aggressively telling me this. I was not doing my homework last min. I was doing it at the end of break because I wanted to enjoy my Christmas break. Doing it the last two days of my break gave me enough time to do my homework therefore it was not last minute. I said that is crazy and unfair. She then came upstairs and continued to yell at me saying she would call the cops on me. I said the cops would call her stupid for calling about me yelling at my brother to stop yelling. She said Ã¢??NO YOUR BREECHING MY PEACE THATS A FELONYÃ¢?Â I said you insane let me do my work leave me alone. She continued to yell saying he can play when he wants. She was mad at me for doing my homework while he was playing. I said he can play but I want him to be quiet. She continued to say he can play whenever. She said IÃ¢??ve had 2 weeks to do my homework. I said heÃ¢??s had 2 weeks to play the game. She replied yelling Ã¢??NO no your doing it last minute he can play whenever he wants this is your fault. I continued to yell youÃ¢??re crazy thatÃ¢??s not fair leave me alone let me work. She then ripped down my curtain rod my door that I got for Xmas (not from her) she didnÃ¢??t get me anything and broke it, leaving me with nothing to cover my door way. Then she left. story of my life. Then she goes and talks with her friends, propaboy lieing about the situation. I hear her whispering to them today about it and say Ã¢??itÃ¢??s just the ageÃ¢?Â IÃ¢??m so confused am I in the wrong here. Please help.

  "Post": "My mom and I got in a physical altercation earlier this year and life's been messy since then. I was always a good student but I have two uncompleted classes from that semester. I have mourned the death of out relationship (that was never really there or never capable of being there) and I understand my mom more and what she went through, why she is the way she is. I'm living with a long time friend a couple days a week and plan to move in there when I turn 18 while I go to school, get myself together, and decide what I want to do. After two years of community college I'll decide where to finish school wether I wanna move out of state or what I wanna pursue\/if I have a serious relationship I want to follow. My friends mom has been a huge resource through this process and her view was that getting Social Services involved could be benificial for my mom getting the help she needs bc it's hard for her to exist in the world. She once told me she's exoirienced every ACE (Adverse Childhood Expirience) and so I know both she and my dad are trying their best but it's not good enough to be suficient parents. (My dad's verbally abusive which I am reading can have lasting affects that outweight or equal physical abuse but he is a stable parent, comes from a more stable family, is resonable in comparison and doesn't have mental health issues other than anxiety which makes him indecisive and submissive to mi mom) Her and her siblings were removed from their home when she was abiut 15 and she moved out on her own with a family she knew... i feel like I might be her but that is ok if I can be a little *less* her. All I want is to be happy. They are always confused on what they want. And take their problems out on me every day it kinda sucks. In deciding what I want to do with my life (and this situation) I talked to multiple caseworkers, gathered information and concluded that it is essentially (at this moment) not usefull to get social servuce involved because it would either a) only complicate things b) if I were removed from my home be put in foster case or c)emacipation is nearly imposible in the state I live in and even if possible a social worker told me that most teens end up worse off aka homeless or struggling with different things. It is hard to live in an unsafe enviroment but that enviroment could be just as unsafe. Right now I am thinking my best bet is to keep learning about personality disorders to understand my mom and hey maybe it'll lead me to a career (maybe not but at least I can share the knowedge with others to help them in the future). They only part that is really hard for me is that I think I can orevent anything from happening to put me in danger but this means that I have to bend to my mom's every mood and that means that I can't really commit to anything, I can't really build anything that is substantial and stable like being in a relationship or anything else that is planned. She refuses to schedule anythign and that means outside of school I can't have anything reliable and that I have to come whenever she calls for fear of anything bad. She does a lot of normal parenting things for the wrong reasons. I know this has\/will\/might cause a lot of issues for me so I am weighing my options supper carefully but the alternative (going to SS) from my research could possibly be just as problematic\/traumatizing. All my options seem ahrd but I feel like there's got to be a third option. I want to get out of this. I want to have a happy prosperous life and I am willing to do anything to get it. \nAny tips or advice? Anyone see a third option? \nAlso would you say it would be bad or benificial for me to be in a relationship in this situation? I feel like it could be unfair to the other person thought they know me well so I feel it could either be a really positice thing or go terribly wrong. Lemme know if you have any thoughts!\nHow do I heal after I get out of this?\nAm I throwing away my life? Will I really be able to pull myself together if I wait this out and all I have to show for it is a bunch of journals filled with depressive stuff and ig some life lessons:)\nThanks for anythingÃ°??Â",

  "Post": "So the teacherÃ¢??s son(who I had been texting for a year and had met up with 4 times) asked me to go to the movies to HANG OUT so I said sure. We got food before and he put his arm around me a couple times but let go quickly, obviously nervous.\n\nWhen we got there he put his hand on my thigh and I acted as if I didnÃ¢??t notice. Once the movie started I put my hand near his and he grabbed it and held it. Then he put his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder, eventually he started lightly kissing(and I mean I couldnÃ¢??t even feel it I thought it was an accident) my neck, hair and shoulder. I was trying to lean away from him(so his head wasnÃ¢??t resting on my shoulder) but he had his arm around me so I couldnÃ¢??t.\n\nI went to the bathroom to freak out to my friends. When I came back I grabbed his hand and held it. He started rubbing my thigh, slowly inching up and kissing my shoulder leaning his head on my shoulder for a second and then sitting back up. His hand got really close to my crotch and I tensed up, he noticed and stopped about 2 inches away from my crotch(*). Then leaving the theatre I grabbed his hand and held it. He was fully aware I had never dated anyone before so I thought this was normal first date things. \n\nAfter I wanted to know what he was thinking so I texted him and he replied(his old Gf is called Chloe)\nÃ¢??Idk I basically acted like I acted when I was with Chloe and when I realised that in fact you are not Chloe and that you are different it was too late but by then you had reciprocated and then I just went with itÃ¢?Â\n\nSo I acted like he didnÃ¢??t just say that and went along with it, until I told him I didnÃ¢??t want to be a rebound, he said I wasnÃ¢??t but he knew why I would think that. I basically just went off on his and we argued for another hour. Then after all that we both kept saying Ã¢??we can just be friends if you wantÃ¢?Â and then I eventually said that and he replied Ã¢??ok gnÃ¢?Â and I said Ã¢??goodbye and sorryÃ¢?Â. I eventually apologised(**). \n\nAftermath:\nI cried a couple tears because I didnÃ¢??t want to stop dating him, but then I realised I didnÃ¢??t really like him, or maybe I do? IÃ¢??m not really sure tbh. He still likes me and thinks I like him. IÃ¢??m keeping up with this whole Ã¢??just being friendsÃ¢?? with him and itÃ¢??s going really well.\n\nWHAT I NEED ADVICE ON:\nDid I overreacted? So now what? Do I tell him? Keep him thinking I like him just incase I change my mind? Do I like him? Did he act inappropriately? If i do like him should I let it continue? I NEED HELP\n\n\n\n* He actually ended up apologised for that after via text and I said it was fine but he said he was really sorry. IÃ¢??m still fine about it he was watching the movie and wasnÃ¢??t paying any attention, donÃ¢??t know why he didnÃ¢??t just move his hand down after tho.\n\n** I said Ã¢??Look, IÃ¢??m really sorry about yesterday. I wasnÃ¢??t really angry at you thinking I was Chloe or whatever I was more upset that I reciprocated and you didnÃ¢??t want that. One of my friends says that I tend to Ã¢??deflect my problems into other peopleÃ¢?? or Ã¢??blame myself for things that arenÃ¢??t my faultÃ¢?? so I think thatÃ¢??s what just happened. Sorry. Also IÃ¢??m off my pill and itÃ¢??s shark week so IÃ¢??m incredibly impulsive and all of my emotions are revved up, complete with mood swings. I know itÃ¢??s not really an excuse but just thought it was relevant information.Ã¢?Â",

She performs songs plays, etc , has a relationship etc. and me? No guy had ever looked my way, my life is literally wake up , school, come home, homework, rinse and repeat. I also have social anxiety so itÃ¢??s hard for me to go out and even then still, I think IÃ¢??m grossly unattractive. Have never ever taken a good picture, last picture I took was for the school yearbook months ago. I simply just donÃ¢??t take pictures. I feel behind everyone and everything. I realize how at my age this decade is literally the decade on change for my generation, but I havenÃ¢??t donÃ¢??t anything. Never been kissed, held hands, complimented, looked at. And it doesnÃ¢??t help that IÃ¢??m a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men, to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways. I just feel behind. I mean the girl I was talking about was the girl I did everything with in elementary and middle school till we moved for high school and she had the most basic things that I canÃ¢??t even get. I mean high schoolers get to yÃ¢??all about relationships, and me, IÃ¢??m here too ugly to even be given a second glance. 2020 is off to the worst possible start.i want to be someoneÃ¢??s first choice. I have friends but I know IÃ¢??m not their first choice, I feel like the leftover friend. I feel like if life is literally not happening for me, I shouldnÃ¢??t even be alive, whatÃ¢??s the point. And I release that yes I need to go out there, but how do I do that when my head is constantly telling me all my flaws, from the shape of my nose to the darkness of my skin, to my introverted personality. I feel defeated, cause I donÃ¢??t want this life if itÃ¢??s all IÃ¢??m getting, watching every body progress and experience while IÃ¢??m stuck and I feel I canÃ¢??t get out.",

Context weÃ¢??re both 17 and I met her at my old school 3 years ago before I moved 2 years ago, we werenÃ¢??t very close but we kinda knew each other. But anyways this convo started out when I asked her if she remembered me she said no. (Red flag 1) but my dumb self didnÃ¢??t think about that. But we talked for a little bit after that and she eventually said she remembered who I was after hearing about some of the classes we were in together and other stuff and after that we talked some more. About 3 days later when I was over at a friends party drunk and high off my ass I decided it was a good idea with my drunk self to confess how I felt since freshman year. And how did that go. Awkwardly as fuck. She said I donÃ¢??t know you which with my drunk self I didnÃ¢??t think was a no but I was drunk so I started asking other questions like if she already had a bf or if she was interested in one or why not. Ps she said no she didnÃ¢??t have a bf, that she really just felt like doing her own thing and just because she didnÃ¢??t feel like it. But when I woke up sober the next morning I texted her a apology and didnÃ¢??t get a response so I kinda just went on about my day. After that day though for like the last 2 weeks I decided I was going to give up on being her bf and just try to be her friend. I tried a way too often to try and start conversations by saying things like hi or whatÃ¢??s up or stuff like that and sending streaks or sending good morning or goodnight. But either way this went on for about 2 weeks without any responses until yesterday where she unfriended me on snap but still let me follow her on Instagram.  So I sent a paragraph long apology on Instagram and now IÃ¢??m waiting to see if sheÃ¢??ll look at it or not. IÃ¢??m emotionally confused, is there anything I can do to fix this situation or is it just done if you read thanks and please if you can leave honest feedback. Ps I donÃ¢??t know if this is the right area for this but it seemed like it",

That was in June. \n\nShe moved away to Baltimore and has been doing A LOT better, sheÃ¢??s not depressed, not self harming and recovering from an eating disorder. \n\nIn August we got into a HEATED argument over what IÃ¢??m going to tell you today. And we stopped talking for two months. \n\nRecently she hasnÃ¢??t been texting me. SheÃ¢??s been ignoring me and leaving me on read, she doesnÃ¢??t text me unless she has something to talk about. Any time I have something to talk about itÃ¢??s always Ã¢??thatÃ¢??s nice\/cool\/goodÃ¢?Â or if IÃ¢??m sad Ã¢??IÃ¢??m sorryÃ¢?Â and then change the subject. When SHE is having problems I try to come up with solutions to her problems and when sheÃ¢??s excited about something I try to act excited also. \n\nSheÃ¢??s stopped referring to me as her best friend and only her friend whereas I call her my best friend. \n\nLast night I texted her this: \nÃ¢??i love you and I know you probably donÃ¢??t but I do and I donÃ¢??t want to ever lose you again so IÃ¢??m gonna keep fighting to keep you in my life even if you donÃ¢??t want to be in my life anymore IÃ¢??ll still fight to keep you in it because I love you so much and youÃ¢??re my best friend even if IÃ¢??m not yoursÃ¢?Â (I copied and pasted it) and she left me on read and hasnÃ¢??t answered me. But sheÃ¢??s been sending me Tik toks all day through the app. \n\nI know people can grow apart, it just hurts so much when youÃ¢??ve done so much for someone, spend hundreds on them (she used to spend weekends with us because her parents kicked her out and weÃ¢??d take her out to eat a lot. Which my mom couldnÃ¢??t afford any ways.) and it feels like itÃ¢??s all thrown away. \n\nPlease help me. What do I do? I donÃ¢??t want to loose her. IÃ¢??m just scared of confronting her about it because I know sheÃ¢??ll get mad.",

  "Post": "The series of events that lead to muy current situation of discontent with muy life begins in September of last year, I went abroad to Canada for 11th grade, in the time I was in Canada (which was on itself a rather unpleasant time) everything changed back home.\n\nBefore I left for Canada my best friend stopped being friends with me after 13 years of friendship because \"my family and I were a bunch of ungrateful people for what he had done for me all these years\" and other stuff he said influenced to him deciding to stop being my friend. So after this I only had 3 friends left (I am not very sociable person and tend to be very shy with people) which are good friends, but the thing is that in my year in Canada they started to hang out with people I don't get with. So by the time I came back from that horrendous place they had over 20 friends all of which I don't know or dislike.\n\nSo 12 grade starts and slowly but surely I start to realise that I honestly have no friends for my 3 are always with this other people, I don't speak to anyone in my classroom and if I do is just because they spoke to me just to laugh at what I say or do. Plus the girl I like who likes and thinks literally exactly the same way I do, thinks I'm kind of a creep because I don't talk that much. \n\nAll of this plus bad grades and pressure at home to decide what I want to study in college is destroying me.",

We ate a delicious Menu and after some glasses of wine and 2 liquor we went to a small place where we ordered a Gin Tonic. Everything was fine till that point. Then 2 other people joined the party, my coworkers knew them very well but I didnÃ¢??t.\nSo I was sitting in this bar and all of a sudden my 2 friends left the club to go sit outside, which I totally overlooked. So I was left with the 2 other ones not knowing what to do... At that point I called my brother on the phone out of instinct. I went outside in order to hear what my brother was saying and I told him to get me, and ended the phone call. Then on my way inside I noticed my 2 friends sitting outside next to a fireplace. I approached them and said that IÃ¢??m going to leave. Then my 2 friends started to down talk me like IÃ¢??m the worst person of the night. Which I probably was... but this whole Ã¢??letÃ¢??s party and pretend that everything is fineÃ¢?? is just not my type. Im not like that.\nAnyway, my friends then said Ã¢??You need to come with us, itÃ¢??s gonna be fun!Ã¢?? \nAnd my other friend said thatÃ¢??s really uncool from me to go home. \nI said Ã¢??Please donÃ¢??t be mad with me, but IÃ¢??m not the right type for that...Ã¢??\nThy then continued to try to get me to go with them.\nÃ¢??YouÃ¢??re part of the Team you canÃ¢??t just leave us, you gotta do the things you donÃ¢??t like, maybe youÃ¢??ll enjoy partying a lotÃ¢?? they said.\nI felt really really really bad from that point because I was leaving. I went inside to get my coat and umbrella, went outside again and said good bye to them and they were just ignoring me. DidnÃ¢??t even say bye to me.

  "Post": " \n\nSo, in the winter of 2018 a girl (well call her G) moved to my city and we had a few classes together and since she was different from al the other (mostly Basic) girls i've started liking her. We've started to hang out and i've developed feelings for her, which i've confessed to her this summer but she rejected me. We've agreed to just stay friends, which i've thought we are to this day. Later this year she invited me to have dancing lessons with her and I agreed. But as its usual where I life i've had a Different dancing Partner. On this Saturday we had a Dance ball. My Mom (who is a Psychological Therapist) observed me and had an deep talk with me about love and stuff. Her words were that almost everyone can see, that i am in love with G. IÃ¢??ve said that were just friends to which she replied, that i've buried and bottled my emotions for her to which iÃ¢??ve started crying bc it's true and i did everything with her thinking were just friends pushing away feelings and subconsciously still loving her. \n\nShe rejected me once saying that she doesn't want a Bf at the time and now im too afraid to ask her about it (and don't even know how to subtly ask if she has feelings for me). She thinks (afaik) that i'm decent looking and that we fit together perfectly. Heck even if we dance together it looks like weÃ¢??ve never did something else (which is an big sign in my opinion). My problem is, that my feelings are still buried and I really don't know what to do or how to sort or unbury my feelings. I would say I love G and I can tell that she has a lot of fun with me if we spend time together.I know, that she has a really low self esteem and Likes to play with otherÃ¢??s feelings. \n\nI'm floating in a big void of questions, so if anyone has tips or advice please share it.\n\nThanks for reading",

From parents, relatives, etc.  My parents said I canÃ¢??t have a nintendo switch several months ago before I turned 18.  I offered to pay for every cent.  I know itÃ¢??s messed up and IÃ¢??m honestly out of energy to tell you why my parents are the way they are, maybe IÃ¢??ll feel like it later if someone asks, but just accept that my parents are crazy and IÃ¢??m trying to keep the peace.\n\nThey got me a Nintendo switch for Christmas last year but I left it on a plane on the way to japan, and since then theyÃ¢??ve changed their minds on video games.  I had a PS4 that they hated me having since I had a FPS (Overwatch, lol) but eventually I caved with stress and pressure and sold it to make them happy even though I loved overwatch and didnÃ¢??t spend too much time on it. I wanted to use the money to get a switch since the games are more family friendly and we can all enjoy it together, but no. \n\nSo anyway, If I get enough money for Christmas\/graduation, can I buy my own Nintendo switch at 18?  Are they allowed to tell me what to do with my money, can they take it away before college or should I get it, keep it at a friendÃ¢??s house, and pick it up on my way to college?  The trouble is, no matter what I do theyÃ¢??ll have to know I got one, and again, trying to keep the peace.  They WILL ground me, take my phone, keep me from friends, keep me from my car, and even keep me from college, but idk if theyÃ¢??re that serious since they didnÃ¢??t give a hard Ã¢??noÃ¢?Â earlier today when I asked if I could buy one. how can I persuade them to let me buy. A family friendly game. WITH MY OWN MONEY. AS AN ADULT. \n\nBut if I get it w\/o them knowing, canÃ¢??t just have the money disappear and when my Mom tells me I should get more clothes for college have to come up for a reason why I canÃ¢??t.  ItÃ¢??s literally the only thing I want, IÃ¢??m desperate and donÃ¢??t wanna wait till I get a job in college next year or next summer.  But if I canÃ¢??t find a solution, I guess I wait?\n\nTL;DR:  Parents wonÃ¢??t let me buy a Nintendo Switch at 18 with my own money and itÃ¢??s literally all I want. How to convince them?",

To make the long story short my father committed suicide the way he did it was the worst part, the gun cabinet opens the night before a day of work for him and I donÃ¢??t know why, the next day he doesnÃ¢??t come home, I donÃ¢??t think anything of it I just stay quiet as it was late. After another day my mind went to the fucking worst, I couldnÃ¢??t help but assume something terrible happened. The whole situation was fucked and there was no indication or note or goodbye, nothing to give closure or conclude anything, I went to bed arguing with him earlier, couldnÃ¢??t even fucking say goodbye, my mom has had it rough for a while but recently in the last year she has taken it out in a Ã¢??dictatorÃ¢?Â mindset and couldnÃ¢??t be wrong or argued with, no rule needs explanation and all her Ã¢??expectationsÃ¢?Â are completely fair.

My 2 sisters (14F) and (11F) are living with my grandmother (67F), and my mother (46F) is partially living with her bf and my grandmother. Now when I say partially, I mean she spends the days and evenings at work with him (they work together) and then sleeps over at his house. She goes back to my grandmotherÃ¢??s house at about 7am to get my sisters on the bus, and doesnÃ¢??t leave her boyfriends house at all on the weekends. (This has been going on for 4 years, and yes I know she IS practically living with her bf but she wonÃ¢??t admit it)\nSo, letÃ¢??s call my sister M. IÃ¢??ve gotten to the point where I just donÃ¢??t know what to do. M is constantly having her gf (13F) over at my grandmotherÃ¢??s and having her spend the night for weeks at a time, even though my grandmother has expressed countless times that she doesnÃ¢??t want her gf there. (The gf has a habit of being a very negative influence on M and being severely disrespectful as a whole) M is also blatantly smoking weed, stealing my grandmotherÃ¢??s cash and keys out of her purse (she now has to hide any and all valuables in her own home), and verbally abuses and curses at my grandmother whenever she doesnÃ¢??t get her way. IÃ¢??ve tried SEVERAL times to get my mother involved and explain the severity of MÃ¢??s behavior, to which she always replyÃ¢??s with empty threats and small slaps on the wrist over phone calls, only every so often does she actually make an appearance, and thatÃ¢??s after my grandmother has begged her to come over and deal with M. \nI donÃ¢??t know why my mother hasnÃ¢??t moved my sisters out with her to her bfÃ¢??s, according to her they are very much in love and a marriage proposal and moving in is on the way (sheÃ¢??s been saying that for 2 years) but something always comes up, or itÃ¢??s poor timing. \nIÃ¢??ve had serious sit down talks with my grandmother, and sheÃ¢??s at a loss too. I absolutely hate seeing whatÃ¢??s become of my family and I just need advice, ANY advice on why M is acting this way and how I can fix it.\n\nQuick background on myself, I have 3 small boys and honestly I have no desire to move M in with me (it has crossed my mind for my grandmotherÃ¢??s sake) but with the way sheÃ¢??s acting, I canÃ¢??t and wonÃ¢??t let my children around her or in that environment.\nAlso, MÃ¢??s father is not present so thereÃ¢??s no other parental figure to turn to.",

I know itÃ¢??s off-putting and kind of dark but I have a really deep respect for it and itÃ¢??s the only job I can see myself liking. My mom wants me to go to college, I do too I guess, but more importantly I want to go to mortuary school. I want so badly to go to mortuary school. The high school I go to right now has an internship program and I had one all set up to work with a funeral home! I was going to be allowed to see the bodies and help with simple embalming tasks, I was so excited I couldnÃ¢??t believe it. My mom came very close to signing the permission slip but decided against it for a few reasons. Embalming fluids (such as formaldehyde) can cause brain cancer after a long exposure, and drug using can be a bit of an issue in the mortuary community due to the numbness the job can make you feel, or not feel. She said she doesnÃ¢??t want me doing the internship and she said if I want to go to mortuary school it would be disrespectful to her wishes, which I understand, but she knows how much I want to do this and how long IÃ¢??ve wanted to do this. She also said she wouldnÃ¢??t help with the cost and if I decided to go, I wouldnÃ¢??t be allowed to live with her. For a little background, my dad died of brain cancer. Which is one if the reasons this is hitting so hard for her. I donÃ¢??t know what to do. I really want this internship and I really really want to go to mortuary school. Anyway this was kind of all over the place but IÃ¢??m just looking for advice, I donÃ¢??t know exactly how to navigate this situation. I understand her concern and where itÃ¢??s coming from and I know that IÃ¢??m not an exception and that I would be at risk too. IÃ¢??ve never wanted anything more than this, this is my whole future and I donÃ¢??t want to be stuck with loads of student debt for a degree I donÃ¢??t care about.

Now, Pat is the first guy IÃ¢??ve liked seriously, and I didnÃ¢??t tell anyone about it at first. IÃ¢??ve never been super private about who IÃ¢??ve liked with my friends, but something felt different this time. I didnÃ¢??t talk with him that much, and we didnÃ¢??t have too many common friends, but even if he paid me a few seconds of attention, letÃ¢??s just say my day was made. HeÃ¢??s funny and smart and just flat out attractive.\n\nA few weeks into liking him, I found out my (F) friend liked him to. I didnÃ¢??t know what to think or how to respond to her, so I kept quiet. Turns out Pat liked her too, and a few weeks later they were dating. \n\nEventually I told my friends, excluding the one dating Pat, about my feelings for him, and it kindve became a running joke in my group. Over the course of them dating, I came to terms with my feelings. I still liked him, a lot, but I realized that I would never date him, and just wanted him to be happy.\n\nThey broke up a few months into the relationship, but it didnÃ¢??t change the way I felt about him. Throughout the rest of the year, he dated one or two other girls, and my group kindve forgot about my problem. It didnÃ¢??t really matter, nothing had changed. It was weird because even though I knew we would never be together, I couldnÃ¢??t move on. I didnÃ¢??t like anyone else, and I felt strangely fine just liking him without him feeling the same way.\n\nFast foreword to this year. My feelings remained strong over the summer. I still liked him, but finally things and changed. I was no longer content just liking him. I know he wouldnÃ¢??t date me, and I just want to move on.\n\nAlong with this development, I met another guy. HeÃ¢??s also straight so it doesnÃ¢??t matter that much, but I guess itÃ¢??s a sign IÃ¢??m moving on? But I still feel just as if not more strongly about Pat.

  "Post": "So hi, my name is Abby. I'm 16 turning 17 soon and I live with my parents. I'm pansexual. I knew I was pan in about 6th grade and thought I was bi for a long time (First female crush in 3rd grade).  Luckily throughout middle school my friends we're very supporting and nice. \n\nMy parents on the other hand are not. My sister is bisexual (remember this) . My mom was raised Catholic so she's homophobic. Though I can't really blame her, she was practically forced to be. My dad on the other hand, is a known racist atheist. I am also an atheist.  My father and sister the other day had a whole conversation about how pansexuality didn't exist. Bisexuality is binary. Boys and Girls. Trans people is iffy. Pansexuality means that I don't base my attraction on gender identity. \n\nI'm so afraid of the reaction I'll get if I come out to my family. Afraid to the point where I'm tempted to wait until I move out to come out to them. My parents are also mentally abusive to my sister and I. Telling us both how useless and worthless we are all the time. My sister gets more than me since she's an adult (20) and they can threaten to kick her out on the street. My sister abuses me, but I don't blame her. She's doing a lot for the family and it all goes unnoticed and ignored. So even though we fight and I hate that she does this to me, I know that not all of her aggression is completely towards me. \n\nGetting past home life, one of my best friends is EXTREMELY homophobic. Even telling me that if I marry a female she won't come to our wedding because \"that's just dumb\".  I once tried to explain what Non binary and gender fluid meant and she again just said \"that's bullshit that makes no sense\" and \"there's only 2 genders. You're either born female or male and that's what you are\" so I can't even get support. To the point where whenever I have a girlfriend and I try to talk about her she fake gags and tells me that it's disgusting. \n\nHow do I get rid of all of this toxicity in my life? Any help?",

I remember being excited to get a job, and now I do nothing and am self aware of my own leeching habits of those around me due to their ability to drive, pay for food, etc. IÃ¢??ve abused it, albeit subconsciously, but nonetheless I have. Another example is that IÃ¢??ve got a very serious relationship that IÃ¢??ve had going on a while. When I was younger, a year or so back, I took her on genuinely decent dates to nice places, but my parents paid because I did chores and was young and lucky enough. Now, we just hit our year and a half, and I didnÃ¢??t even take her to dinner, and barely gave a present for her birthday. \n\nThere are worse things to do, but IÃ¢??m not proud of who IÃ¢??ve become and what IÃ¢??m doing with my life as of this point. IÃ¢??m not dumb, I know IÃ¢??m not, because I wouldÃ¢??ve been shit out of luck years ago, yet I lack the work ethic or motivation. \n\nThe worst part of it is my health. IÃ¢??m a pothead, IÃ¢??ve smoked daily for 3 years straight now, with the obvious breaks sometimes. But itÃ¢??s bad, and so is my sleep schedule. My physical health was also way better a long time ago, so mentally and physically IÃ¢??m just not me anymore. ItÃ¢??s not even about looks, itÃ¢??s about not feeling under the weather or groggy or irritable. \n\nTo everyone reading, it may seem like pandering to compliments or support, but thatÃ¢??s not my goal here. IÃ¢??m just kind of trying to explain my perspective, so please bear with me if you will. \n\nGenerally, the only things keeping me going are my girlfriend, family, friends and drugs. I donÃ¢??t have much to say for myself. I havenÃ¢??t done anything to proud of recently except make it this far.  I suppose I wrote this post because, like I said, IÃ¢??m not entirely stupid, just kind of lost and donÃ¢??t know what to do to even get myself the strength to get out of bed anymore. School counselors say I have depression and anxiety, and parents\/close friends say IÃ¢??m always stressed, so IÃ¢??m clearly not me. \n\nThe point is, IÃ¢??m lost, and IÃ¢??m not happy. I know I can be, but IÃ¢??m not. Not like I was- I remember it. I need help. I could ask a sum of questions but itÃ¢??d be too long. So, to shorten it: To any adults, or wiser people out there, how do I get back on track? How do I even start? Is there anything I can do get myself back on my feet before I make bigger steps? Is there any habits or small things I can start changing now?\n\nThanks for reading this far. I probably shared too much but this is pretty anonymous account (I hope). I appreciate any sort of advice I can get, anything you think will help.",

  "Post": "I don't think anyone will see this but I'm writing it anyway.\nMy best friend and I have been friends for awhile now. She's really kind and caring for me. She supports me when I need it which I tend to cause I struggle often with my family. We can all her R.\nR is a busy person. They do lots of sports and training that she no longer enjoys but can't get out of. Her mother has her under a similar system of life 360 and put her in therapy after discovering R was self harming. R often jokes about razors and cutting. At the beginning of our friendship she'd get scared I'd stop being her friend and would say things like \" if you'd ever leave I'd start cutting\". That later stopped and things seemed normal. She doesn't tend to have a filter in public. And doesn't enjoy talking about her feelings.\nShe was recently diagnosed with minor depression.  She told me she doesn't talk to her therapist and doesn't want to. I suggested getting a new therapist but she said no. I suggested talking to the social worker at our school cause R enjoyed their company but she declined once more. It's gotten to the extent where if I suggest talking she refuses and says she'd rather bottle it up than talk about it. Very recently she texted me telling me she wanted to commit suicide and after several attempts of convincing her not to she stopped responding so I texted her mother and told my own. I then called her mother only for R to answer herself with the words \"skeet skeet\". At that moment I was shaking and crying and sweating and hearing her normal humorous voice make a joke I immediately hung up. She then texted me saying her phone died with laughing emojis. I was upset and told her not to joke about it. I then asked if she was serious and she replied with yes. I then told her I would not hesitate to tell an adult if that situation happened again. She then left me on read after saying her phone was gonna die.\nI feel like R will not accept help and gets upset if I try to tell someone. To be completely honest for a few other reasons I've recently doubted our friendship. I'm not at all in a good mental state and A knows that. Frankly I don't know what to do. I'm so conflicted with this problem while in the midst of struggling with other problems.",

  "Post": "Was told I should post here too. Sorry if not appropriate forum.  Throwaway account: ItÃ¢??s long.  Im so sorry... A month ago, I lost a lucrative job in nursing. Lucrative For nursing yes - but we still lived paycheck to paycheck and I rent a expensive home that looks dilapidated with an unresponsive landlord and a city that allows it. IÃ¢??m a nurse by trade. Most hear that and think, oh sheÃ¢??s well to do. IÃ¢??m a single mom of two kids and student loans out the wazoo. And I only recently began making decent money. Prior to that we barely got by. Prior to losing my job, my biggest issue began with my 17 yo daughter and the passing of her dad. Our son is too young to care, heÃ¢??s only 4. And dad was minimally involved with him anyhow. He wasnÃ¢??t much more involved with my daughter either. But that doesnÃ¢??t matter. He was their father. And he was on a pedestal. No matter how little he did for her or how many times he lied, stood her up, or broke her heart. He had been an opioid addict on and off the last 12 years. We were married but very quickly estranged bc of the drug use. I would not enable him. His family and my own daughter blames me for that now bc Ã¢??if you had stuck with him love would have gotten him through and he wouldnÃ¢??t be dead nowÃ¢?Â, etc. ThatÃ¢??s one of the nicer things thatÃ¢??s been said. He went through multiple rehab attempts (20). The night he passed, he had left rehab after for the first time ever completing the program. He was clean. But we didnÃ¢??t know this. She didnÃ¢??t know this. She knew his past behavior. And I never ever spoke an ill word against him. She was old enough to see him for herself. I never had to. I would simply say things like well, he is your father and he does deserve a certain degree of respect and would leave it at that. He reached out to her the night of completing rehab (for his annual bs story in her eyes) by FB messenger saying Ã¢??hey baby girl, IÃ¢??m clean again, and I love you. I want to see you.Ã¢?Â  She responded (like I believe any child would) angry and not believing what sheÃ¢??s heard and not seen her whole life. She told him exactly this Ã¢??I donÃ¢??t believe you one bit. I hate you for what youÃ¢??ve done to me. A child is supposed to have their father especially a daughter. I needed you and you werenÃ¢??t there and you never will be. ItÃ¢??s only a matter of time before that needleÃ¢??s back in your arm and I donÃ¢??t matter anymore. Like usual. My whole life Shawn. [she never called him dad] You donÃ¢??t love me. You donÃ¢??t even love yourself.Ã¢?Â  And that was their last exchange. And I tell her time and time again she was and still is entitled to her anger and to feel the way she feels. But it only encourages the guilt. He was found the next morning with a needle in his arm. She blames herself wholeheartedly for his death. She literally feels as though she injected him herself. SheÃ¢??s had MULTIPLE stays at a psychiatric hospital as sheÃ¢??s cutting and using drugs, marijuana, pills, hallucinogens, and IÃ¢??m sure more thatÃ¢??s just what sheÃ¢??s confessed to or have found. Using in my home. Ruining her future. Smoking cigarettes. Failing her courses. (A previous honor student obtaining college credits with plans to graduate early but that is no longer the case). No longer participating in extracurricular activities she previously adored. Volunteering. Lying. Hanging with the wrong crowd. Cutting school. You name it. Following the loss of her dad, her Grandparents have given her two old first time cars (not at the same time and not same grandparents, were all poor lol) thinking that would help improve her spirits. The first car given her, she totaled on ice and had to be cut out with the jaws of life after hitting a steel pylon. The second, an SUV that she also wrecked but this wasnÃ¢??t her fault. She was T boned. She feels like she has nothing and everything she gets, people and material things, donÃ¢??t last. Breaks my heart. I know sheÃ¢??s mad. WeÃ¢??ve seen multiple counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Weve medicated her with things IÃ¢??ve never even heard or as a nurse for over a decade. And I will be the first to be against meditating a marrying brain. SheÃ¢??s attempted studies three times now. WeÃ¢??ve gone to teen group loss sessions, but no one understands what sheÃ¢??s going through. We canÃ¢??t even talk without her screaming at me. Ã°??Â¢ And we still have no diagnosis. I feel this is deeper than the loss of her dad and maybe the stimulus that has exacerbated the mental illness? But without a job and income I canÃ¢??t afford her meds or multiple appointments. I applied for medical card and was DENIED. IÃ¢??m at a loss and have fourteen more days of medications (not that theyÃ¢??re helping they much lol) left before all hell breaks loose. \n\nIÃ¢??m 34 years old. IÃ¢??m a nurse. IÃ¢??ve been a nurse for 12 years. I should have it together better than I do but I donÃ¢??t. I donÃ¢??t even own my home. My kids arenÃ¢??t spoiled. We shop at yard sales and Goodwill or Salvation Army. My lucrative job paid additional toward my $60k student loans. While employed I carried minimal essential coverage which covers none of what sheÃ¢??s going through or needs. The cars had liability only and were complete losses. Her hospital bills, appts, and meds I canÃ¢??t even fathom into my budget. Even to make payments! Her insurance bills I canÃ¢??t even come close to paying. I can barely afford our rent and itÃ¢??s more than that. My credit sucks yet I pay my bills. My student loans are equivalent to my rent. IÃ¢??m a good nurse, I donÃ¢??t even play cards!! (Sorry has to break the tension a little lol) I love my patients genuinely and I take care of them as tho theyÃ¢??re my own favorite relative and I expect nothing less from my staff. I had been employed for 12 years at the same facility and upon an ownership change I was let go. Out of the blue. We didnÃ¢??t even know we were for sale and I was director of nursing. No severance. Nothing. My heart breaks for my kids but I feel so selfish for worrying so much about finances and canÃ¢??t see past the bulls to mourn the loss with my kids. I literally donÃ¢??t know what to do. IÃ¢??ve had several interviews but remain Ã¢??overqualifiedÃ¢?Â for a nursing position I can obtain quickly. But time is of the essence. My late husband worked under the table when he worked. Otherwise he was a drug dealer. So social security isnÃ¢??t even an option. IÃ¢??ve never felt so lost and hopeless before. Any advice that can be give would be much appreciated. Thanks for sticking with my rant. Feels better just to have put it all down and gotten it out. Just need some advice and an ear to bend. Thanks again, Reddit friends.\nPS: And why do I feel so jealous that IÃ¢??ve done it all for them both and she puts him on a pedestal and treats me like crap all the time?!? Am I really that selfish? The way she tells me she hates me I canÃ¢??t imagine her missing me like she misses him and it makes me mad, sad, jealous, and hurt all at the same time. How can I get over this and get back on top? Or at least week to week?",

All my life IÃ¢??ve suffered mental illness and last year was officially diagnosed with psychosis. IÃ¢??ve had a lot of struggles with my parents especially. Growing up in a physically and mentally abusive household brought out my inherited psychosis. I have only been allowed to leave the house once a week. There is no reason, thatÃ¢??s the way I grew up. I do not get hit at anymore and IÃ¢??ve had to face Child Protective Services, but I still have the fears that this is all a delusion. My boyfriend of almost two years has helped me throughout everything and has suffered problems himself. This is what leads into my dilemma. My mother and brother have Aspergers and are incredibly intelligent. So, I always get scolded and get compared to my brother and other children. They ask me why I cannot be like them, be mentally stable and smart. By the way, my brother is 19 and we still have to cook for him, wake him up, drive him and let him lay around. I got into an argument with my mother this morning about my grades. Now, I am by no means intelligent. I have a horrendous memory (the doctors say itÃ¢??s from trauma and PTSD, though my therapist thinks thereÃ¢??s a personality link when I switch) No matter how difficult I try my grades never improve. I have awful self esteem and cry about it often, though their anger toward me only seems to grow. I get help and do all of the work, but I only get punished even more. My doctors have told my parents not to isolate me(as that would make my health worse) but they donÃ¢??t heed their advice :\/ once allowed out once a week, now I am no longer to leave the house unless for school and doctors appointments. I do have some outstanding assignments, but not much at all. I do awful on the tests and it hurts my grade. I have a D-, nearly an E in geometry and is almost the end of the year. IÃ¢??ve been told IÃ¢??m not good enough. Not recently, but is what my parents doing reasonable? Am I just not understanding and not doing enough?! Please help me :(",

I wasn't the most popular kid in school, Wouldn't say badly bullied to the point of depression, but bullied as such, I mainly brushed it off. I left school with a couple friends, now I rarely even see my best friend, he's either with his girlfriend, in college or in bed, I've started smoking the herb to try to see life differently but that's just making it harder to do basic life functions, I'm trying to push my self to go out on walks alone (Not really for my fitness as I work out regularly, but besides the point). Does anyone have any tips on getting over this loneliness? Is it an age thing? Or is it one of those things you never got warned about? Thank you",

We are best friends so I told her that I canÃ¢??t just act like I donÃ¢??t like her for long. So yesterday she told me that she had mixed feelings over the school year and that she likes me. I got happy so I told me friend about it.

Of course I didnÃ¢??t feel right so I had my friend say that he was the one that typed that when I was in the restroom, he told her that he was just playing and she got pissed. I didnÃ¢??t feel right with him technically asking her out so I did it again. I asked her out again and she said Ã¢??can we talk in personÃ¢?Â, I agreed and at the end of school I walked with her and asked her what she wanted to talk about. I didnÃ¢??t tell her about the previous situation . This time she said something about how we couldnÃ¢??t date because of her parents. I did stuff that her parents didnÃ¢??t like, which where cussing in text, and saying the n word in text. I tried to say that I could change and stop doing that stuff but other friends kept intervening. For the rest of the day we kept flirting and acting like a couple, like leaning on each other, talking about when we started liking each other. Later that night I felt guilty about not telling her what happens in class, so I texted her two big paragraphs about why I did it. I told her that I didnÃ¢??t feel right with the fact that we like each other and canÃ¢??t be a couple, how I wanted to let you know I asked you out and to let her know I did it.

I am 13 and I am in need for $5000 because I really want to buy a new phone, specifically Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which actually costs $5988 at the moment but I'm sure I'll somehow the price will drop by the time I do have the money. First of all, I cannot sell my old phone because my parents said that it technically is their phone, because they bought it for me, and that they have authority over my phone. And I don't like that. I want a phone that really belongs to me. Secondly, I can't use my pocket money because to my parents it is for our-daughter-but-we-will-make-sure-she-doesn't-use-any-of-it purposes. I can't do something illegal because I am a mere piece of trash, and I don't want my future to be any trashier. I tried earning money online but obviously doing surveys for  Swagbucks can't really help and I cannot apply for any online jobs, or do any stock investments. I made a PayPal account only to find out that it can't help either. I am planning to sell my hair but then I am not Rapunzel so I don't think my hair will cost $5000. I can't mow lawns, or walk the neighbour's dog, and babysit someone's kid, put up a lemonade stand, tutor someone, because, well, it's impossible to see kids doing that in Hong Kong. And I don't even know my neighbours that well. I am a student with poor grades so I can't really help another person with their grades. I might do some music covers and post them on Youtube, add some ads, but then, ads are my pet peeves, I won't do that to others in order to earn money, and most of all, I sound like a frog when I sing. In conclusion, I am a talentless, worthless, and broke student who needs $5000 in 4 months. I can't stand using a phone that doesn't really belong to me. Please give me some ideas on how to earn money, like $5000 in 4 months, please. It's okay if you say something like \"Duh! Kid, you're impossible.\" I'm used to it. Please just comment something. Thanks a lot. Have a great day.\n\nFrom,\n\nJes",

I always will be, I mean she worked really hard for it and she completely deserves it. But the thing is, my parents were soo happy. My dad even started crying. \nI mean it's okay really, but that got me thinking of how I never gave my parents that sort of happiness. They were constantly talking about how great of a job she has and how it's so prestigious for them. It was sweet at first but after a while it became our every night dinner discussion. And if thing didn't get worse they started bringing me up. How I would have to outshow my sister and get into a good college. After months of hearing these things everyday, I started getting triggered. I would often have panic attacks and even mental breakdowns. I told my parents about this and their reply was that they had every right to have expectations from me.\n This continued till January when I got so depressed that I started cutting myself. I eventually got help from my friend and now I am a lot more stable but I still feel terrified to not be able to live up to their expectations.",

I admit I don't have friends more of associates. I'm 17 and never had a girlfriend and don't really care for sex that much. Like I'm a virgin so I don't really care for something I haven't have before you know (or maybe im just scared to fuck idk it could be either one). With that being said I do like this girl. She's dope and I want her to my girlfriend. I told my cousins about this and they said \"If I don't want to fuck her or flirt with her what's the point of dating? Why won't I her just make her a close friend.\" It got me to think and now I feel like I want her because I see her as and this my be weird but as a \"best friend that's also wifey material\" like I can see myself and her have a family together. Now thinking about this Reddit pr the internet in general is probably the worst place to become vulnerable but whatever. I wrote this poem for her but I didn't give to her because she wasn't there for Valentine's Day and I heard the day after is \"Sidechick Day\" and of course I didn't want her to think she's a side chick.

  "Post": "iÃ¢??ve known this friend for like 5ish years, and sheÃ¢??s seriously starting to annoy me. i donÃ¢??t know exactly what she did but iÃ¢??m literally around her 24\/7, from being in the same friend group as her to being on the same team as her, thereÃ¢??s literally 1 day out of the week i donÃ¢??t see her, and iÃ¢??m so annoyed. i sit with her at lunch with our 2 other friends, i have a class with her almost everyday with one of our other friends, and like i mentioned iÃ¢??m on the same team as her, and at most iÃ¢??m with said team 4\/7 days of the week. \n\nlike i said iÃ¢??ve known her for so long but weÃ¢??re not even that close. i tell her some things, like minor problems in my life but i just feel so uncomfortable telling her anymore than that, and she doesnÃ¢??t bring them up either. but, since iÃ¢??m always around her (because iÃ¢??m not THAT close with my other friends in our friend group\/on our team) itÃ¢??s normal for my other friends to leave me alone with her if that makes sense. i just feel like people associate us with each other in a way, since sheÃ¢??s always around me, and i donÃ¢??t like that for some reason.\n\ni like my other friends better, i feel so much more comfortable around my other friends than i do around her. yesterday we were at another school for a competition with my team. she accidentally got split from us and i was alone with the other 2 girls and it was so relieving to not be around her and as soon as she came back it was like.....stuffy. \n\ni guess itÃ¢??s because iÃ¢??m around her all the time that i feel this way but i just genuinely donÃ¢??t want to be around her at all anymore. unfortunately for me, i have another 4 day week with my team, 3 days of school with her, and she basically invited herself over to spend the night at my house this weekend because her familyÃ¢??s gonna be out of town. i would tell my mom or one of my other friends i feel this way but i feel like theyÃ¢??d be so surprised because itÃ¢??s out of the blue, since i normally act like everythingÃ¢??s ok. however, i sometimes am just a dick to her, not on purpose really it just happens. \n\ni donÃ¢??t even know why iÃ¢??m friends with her? we have the same sense of humor but thatÃ¢??s literally it. we donÃ¢??t watch any of the same shows, like any of the same music, all we have in common is our friends, our sense of humor (a bit), and being on the same team. thatÃ¢??s it. i have so much more in common with my other friends, but this friend in particular has talked shit about the music\/shows my other friends watch\/listen to, to me, and i donÃ¢??t really talk about music or shows i like with her a lot cause itÃ¢??s just not what we talk about so it kinda made me feel bad in a way. \n\ni genuinely donÃ¢??t know what to do, because like i said i like my other friends more but i canÃ¢??t just randomly cut ties with this friend because everyone around me would think itÃ¢??s weird. i just hate being around her all the time. i donÃ¢??t really like being around people in general, i get too overwhelmed. i prefer to be alone most of the time so this is a really unfortunate situation for me to be in. i donÃ¢??t know what to do at all, and i feel like i canÃ¢??t talk to anybody about it, what should i do?\n\nalso, i would sit with the other girls from our team however, one of them is homeschooled and only comes to the school for practices and such, and one has her own friend group (iÃ¢??m referring to the two girls i mentioned earlier) and iÃ¢??m just not close with the other people on my team like that. just those 2. and even then, this friend is also friends with them too since we were all hanging out yesterday at our competition so sheÃ¢??d most likely follow me to sit with them. \n\nEDIT: also i said earlier it wasnÃ¢??t anything she did but yeah nvm it is, she always asks me to buy her food and tells me to buy new clothes when for example my shoes are dirty and i guess you could say my family kinda struggles financially? and she comes from a rich family so she obviously doesnÃ¢??t understand but i feel like by now she should. i tell her no because sheÃ¢??ll stand there saying Ã¢??buy me _____Ã¢?Â like 500 times when iÃ¢??m standing in the lunch line and she wonÃ¢??t shut up and yeah whatever it is isnÃ¢??t expensive but she always forces me into buying it for her when itÃ¢??s her fault she never brings food to school\/doesnÃ¢??t buy lunch for herself. and she makes me feel bad about my clothing and always tells me my food looks gross? idk itÃ¢??s not that big of a deal but itÃ¢??s genuinely so annoying. and currently sheÃ¢??s spamming my phone because i wonÃ¢??t answer her texts so.....",

  "Post": "So in my class, there's this guy, I never tried getting close with ever since he entered school last year. We're the same batch. We  always sit close to each other but the thing is, we never tried getting to know one another and become literal friends. Until, this year started, he suddenly asks me with assignments, flood messages me, always ask things from me, and when I talk to this friend of mine in front of me about stories he enters the conversation all of a sudden, then I, SOMETIMES, CAUGHT HIM LOOKING AT ME!!!!!!! Also, when I'm in a certain place in the classroom, he goes there too! And when he laughs, he looks at me! Pleassseeeee helppp, I don't know what's going on! You think? \\[By the way, add the fact, that there's an issue that might make him think that I like HIM!\\]",

  "Post": "My mum and my dad got divorced when I was about six and since then have each found a new wife\/husband. I donÃ¢??t mind my step mum or my dad or mum but my step dad is the worst. We just never see eye to eye. Aswell as that he doesnÃ¢??t treat me like any of my siblings. It makes me so upset and angry the way that he treats me and I know sometimes I cause the drama by getting angry at him. But he just takes it way to far. IÃ¢??ll always walk off and apologise later. But every time he yells and yells and swears at me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I would never leave to stay and my dads full time but I just donÃ¢??t know how to cope with him. Anyone have any advice? ",
